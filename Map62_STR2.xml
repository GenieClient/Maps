    <description>Worn down to a dusky grey color, the proud wood once cut and fitted to compose this gondola creaks with age and disrepair, but appears to be steady.  Seats have been lifesculpted up from the floor and melded into the sides.  Weak light streams in through the yellow-tinted windows, eating away patiently at what little color remains in the tiny, musty chamber.</description>

    <description>Like an aerie forgotten in the wilderness, the platform remains despite being abandoned by its creators.  While rickety and creaking uneasily, it appears to have held up well.  Two side-by-side granite beams rise up from the edge of the ridge, around which have been wound the lengths of rope used by the gondola that provides transport over the great chasm.</description>

    <description>The mountain trail comes to an abrupt end at the edge of a massive chasm with sheer walls that fall down into darkness.  Twin thick cables of some indiscernable substance hang over the chasm, tied off on this end to a rickety platform that looks about as stable as a faenrae reaver on samatak.</description>

    <description>Twilight dances across the horizon.  Shadow and starlight mingle in their ever-eternal dance, forever young, forever lovely from their places in the sky.  The twisted figures of rocks sit sullenly on the earth, an unwilling and immortal audience to the night's performance.</description>

    <description>The forest clears out a bit, allowing a gap in the tree cover that provides a glimpse of sky overhead.  Attached to one tree is a weathered plank with one lone nail still keeping it affixed.  Occasional sounds of running water can be heard in the distance, but the echoes within the trees prevent any idea of where they are coming from.</description>

    <description>Gurgling sounds come from the west, perhaps from a stream or spring hidden within the dense forest.  The thorn bushes crowd close to the narrow track, grabbing at passersby almost as if they were alive and wanted to keep intruders out.</description>

    <description>Crumbling stone walls end at a gateway inset into the dilapidated enclosure.  Formed from wrought iron bars set upright within a frame, the two panels of the gate have fallen off their hinges and lean drunkenly against the arched gateway.  The gaping space thus formed allows access into the courtyard beyond, while further progress on the pathway is blocked by a wall of thorn bushes.</description>

    <description>Weeds push through the cobbles of the courtyard which lies within the enclosing stone walls.  An arched gateway pierces the enclosure, allowing egress through the ramparts.  Two gate panels lie off their hinges in the gateway, leaning against the walls like drunken soldiers sleeping off a late night drinking bout.  The grass-choked yard stretches to the west and north, while a tower rises to the northwest.</description>
