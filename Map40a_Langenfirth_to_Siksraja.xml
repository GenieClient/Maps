    <description>Like an acrobat walking a tightrope, this small stretch buffers the forest from the bog and balances life on both sides.  Scrubby pine needles dropped on the path await nature's method of movement.  Crushed on the frozen snow or mashed into the moist spring ground, the next rain will sweep them into the bog to become part of the rich silt that will wash up in the next flood to nourish the surrounding lands.</description>

    <description>Almost buried in the fallen pine needles that cover the area between Gwenalion Fens to the east and Seord'telgi Teorn to the north, this narrow path wanders westward towards the distant hills.  Small sounds of a village at sleep -- a baby's hungry cry, a dog barking, a lone door slamming -- are wafted by the wind and populate the forest with echoes.</description>

    <description>A huge oak grows just far enough away from the fens to be on solid ground but not far enough from the bog for travelers to squeeze between it and the fens.  The path curves to the drier side and exchanges the scent of moist rot for that of the forest.  Overhead, a large pine branch drapes the path and often catches the unaware in an arboreal necklace.</description>

    <description>Slowly, almost unnoticed, the elevation changes as rolling hills on one side meet a small valley on the other.  The growth here is mostly hay mingled with grass and a random bush.  A variety of tracks cross the road headed for the flowing stream as the pair runs side-by-side into the distance.</description>

    <description>Spilling around boulders and debris, the stream splashes over huge rounded rocks alongside the hillside footpath, merrily gurgling and rushing its white foamy way downhill to dive beneath a bridge where the brook drops into a deep sinkhole.  The path turns sharply away from the hole, and continues over the small rope bridge that provides passage over the rocky waterway.</description>

    <description>Anchored by fist-thick ropes, this bridge spans the swirling water, damp from the spray and foam as its weathered floor planks echo hollowly with each footstep.  The rope handholds are formed from loops knotted in the lines that drop from the overhead cables and meet in visible latticework between the meager planks.  Two large trees on either side are swaddled to their upper limbs in cable, as they stand guard over the land approaches to the bridge.</description>

Near the center of the room is a simple silverwood desk, the only furniture in this sparse office.

    <description>Dug through the earth, an expansive hallway curves to the northeast, cutting through a vein of rock and sand.  The excavated tunnel is supported with stone and timber pillars.  Painted along the walls are flowing patterns, a mosaic of hand prints and crude sketches of figures kneeling before a very large multi-limbed being.  The ground is hard packed but rippled, the sand pushed by strong and erratic air currents from the north.</description>

    <description>A strong breeze comes from the north, fine particulates flowing along the ground and collecting in loose piles against the walls.  The stone wall is covered from floor to ceiling in indecipherable characters which are worn nearly smooth with the passage of sand.  The imagery depicts a very large multi-limbed figure, surrounded by written words and icons.  The figure appears to be grappling with what is either a mountain or a castle.</description>

    <description>The hallway terminates in a perfectly flat and level wall of sand which continually sheds material, a strong breeze carrying stinging grains to the south.  A muffled cacophony of grinding stone can be heard beyond the barrier and is still quite loud despite the auditory damping of the compacted sand.  Along the stone side wall, a carved mosaic of worn words flows smoothly into the sandy obstruction, which abruptly obscures half of an image of a word-wrapped figure kneeling within a starburst.</description>

The waters lap silently against the little island, gently swaying almost imperceptibly up and down the gradual slope of the shoreline.
