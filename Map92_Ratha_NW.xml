    <description>Tall timbers and rough-hewn stone form a giant gate in the great wall.  Standing open for the streams of wagon and foot traffic to pass through, the entrance to Ratha is carefully guarded by observant sentinels who watch every passerby with trained eyes.</description>

    <description>Cloaked travelers slip in and out of the gate, wrapped up against the chill of the night and carrying torches and lanterns to light their way.  Although there are relatively few folk passing through at this hour, the gate guards seem particularly alert as they assess each person, keeping one eye on the shadows.</description>
    <description>All manner of travelers mill about the gate, either waiting their turn to enter or pushing through the crowds in the opposite direction if they're leaving.  Farmers pass through with wagonloads of produce and grain, fishermen with their catches, and rangers with bundles of hides.  The gate guards look on, watching everyone.</description>

    <description>The well-maintained gravel road connects the farmland to the northwest with the walled city to the southeast.

All that's left are some scrubby grasses and a few patches here and there of a particularly ugly creeper.  An occasional insect creeps, hops or buzzes about its business, but even the bugs have largely sought more hospitable terrain.</description>

    <description>The road runs close by the edge of the barley fields to the west.  On the opposite side of the way the land resembles a rural garbage heap.  The farmers apparently dumped stumps and boulders dug out of the fields across the road, and then continued dumping anything else they didn't want there in subsequent years.  Beyond the narrow strip of rocks and refuse the land rises in a steep slope, a berm covered with grass and weeds and loose-looking rocks.</description>

    <description>Rustling in the dark fields indicates that someone, or some thing, is doing some night harvesting, and it's probably not the farmer who crops this land.  The occasional barking of a dog identifies the source of at least some of the rustling, but dogs don't eat barley.</description>
    <description>Birds flutter back and forth, alternating between raiding the barley fields to the west, and hopping about the refuse piles to the east in search of whatever might be in there that is of interest to birds.  They seem to prefer the barley fields, but farm children with slings make raiding that particular cornucopia somewhat hazardous.</description>

    <description>The steep berm rising to the east blocks the view in that direction, but a cool breeze blowing down the slope bears the scent of water.  A narrow path winds through the rubbish on the east side of the road, past a rotting cart with no wheels and around an unstable pile of boulders, but there's no fixed path up the berm.  Its rocky slope is only partially anchored by foliage, and the rest looks very shifty.  The path continues to the west, disappearing into the barley.</description>

    <description>Rippling barley fills the fields to the west, from the road all the way to the base of the volcano.  The fields appear to be very fertile and the crop bountiful.

Judging by the calls and twitters, there are at least two kinds of birds out there, but it's too dark to see more than an occasional dark flutter of a silhouette against the starry black of the sky.</description>
    <description>Farmers work in the fields on the west side of the road, moving slowly along the rows with a wagon trailing them.  Someone is singing a slow song in S'Kra, and a number of farmers in one area are swaying slightly in time with the tune.</description>

But in the night it's closed and still, just a boxy shadow in the dark.</description>
    <description>The children of a farmer have set up a little stand in the bend of the road.

    <description>The road takes a sharp turn here at the corner of a field.  The farmer who tends this land is a little overly enthusiastic about filling the drainage ditches, and water spills over onto the road somewhere to the northwest, making this stretch soggy.  A wide variety of slimes and mosses have taken over different ruts and corners, making all this mud most interesting for a dedicated natural philosopher, and a slippery nuisance for everyone else.</description>

    <description>Two large Gor'Togs, a male and a female, work side by side on a pedal-mill.  Constructed of old lumber lashed together, the rickety contraption lifts water out of the flowing irrigation ditch and dumps it into the smaller ditch leading off into the kord field west of the road.

It's a futile effort, however, since the gravel simply sinks into the mud and vanishes whenever it's walked on.  The road is wet and slippery, and the gravel only serves to bring to mind the likelihood of a few nasty cuts if one takes a spill, in addition to the inevitable mud on one's clothes.</description>

    <description>A huge black pit opens up in the ground to the southeast side of the road.  It's too dark to tell how deep it might be, but the vast, gaping maw might well go all the way down to the home of the world dragon, or so it seems.</description>
    <description>A large pit opens up in the ground to the southeast side of the road.  Sweating workmen labor bent over in the pit, some swinging pickaxes and others loading rock into carts with large shovels.  It looks like hard, dirty work and a miserable life for anyone to have to lead.</description>

    <description>This lonely piece of road runs between a thin stretch of wood to the northwest and a dark, wide hole in the ground to the southeast.  Ominous sounds come from both sides of the track, rustling and calling, with an occasional spine-shivering howl from the woods, and rattling and scrabbling sounds from the pit.  Neither is terribly comforting on a cold, dark night.</description>
    <description>The sounds of hard labor drift out of the gravel pit to one side of the road.  The whacking of pickaxes, the scrape and crash of rock being loaded with shovels, the ringing of sledge hammers and the rattle of gravel in sorting screens all blend into a chaotic din that assaults the ears.  The woods on the other side of the road are thin, with many stumps and few grown trees.  The wooden scaffolding and sheds and lean-tos down in the pit show where the wood likely went to.</description>

    <description>Gravel from the road goes rattling down into the pit every few minutes, returning to where it originally came from.  The road here is wide enough to be safe, despite the nearness of the pit on one side, but the huge black maw is frightening enough to send one to travel as far over on the opposite side as possible.</description>

    <description>A dark pit opens up on the southeast side of the road.  It's impossible to tell how deep it is, but in the darkness of the night it looks bottomless.  The road runs perilously near the edge of the pit, and understandably most of the wheel ruts crowd the opposite side of the track, which runs near a wooded area.</description>
    <description>Workers swarm around a series of lean-tos and awnings down at the bottom of the huge gravel pit that gapes open on the southeast side of the road.  Carts move between the deepest areas of the pit and the awnings, and to a rickety wooden elevator standing near several huge hills of gravel.</description>

A small gap at its base is too dark to see into, but the crusted piles of dirt in a half-circle around it suggest that something inside is having an addition put onto the back of the house.  The burrow has been cleverly placed on the downhill side of the boulder, so it's well sheltered from rain and water running down the slope.</description>

The underbrush is woody, tangled and dense.  No flowers grow nearby, nor even much grass save for a few yellowish tufts here and there.

Several cracks spider along the nearby boulders, and large chips of stone littering the area primarily around the skeletal form suggest the creature did not go down without a fight.  A swath of rippled igneous rock forms a causeway that has long since cooled and been worn down by the passing wildlife.

Nearly constant gusts of hot, humid air stream downward bringing noxious fumes reeking of sulfur.  A thin trickle of muddy water runs along the center of the valley, swirling with a thick yellow slime.  Bushes grow along the edges of the valley and the cliff walls, a significant distance from the slow stream.  A narrow path leads towards the base route.</description>

Fine cracks in the stone reveal veins of dark mineral deposits, their glossy surfaces reflecting in the light.  A driftwood obelisk stands to the east, its irregular form tucked against the cliff face.</description>

    <description>Nestled against a natural rock wall, a wide ledge offers reprieve from the constant wind.  Stacked stones form crude seats, their surfaces worn smooth by the elements.  A large driftwood obelisk is visible to the southwest, its sea-worn branches skillfully arranged to resemble an outstretched wing.</description>
