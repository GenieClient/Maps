    <description>The northwestern corner of the city is curiously barren of both houses and trees, save for a single building set well away from the street.  A peculiar aroma from the building wafts over the crushed shell path, bringing the scent of curing animal hide.  The only entrance is a wooden gate leading to the tanning courtyard.</description>

The northern screen walls stand open to allow a view of the courtyard.  A crystal windchime tinkles softly whenever the wind stirs it, but the overhanging roof and construction of the building keeps any harsh weather from disturbing the visitor.  A low brazier burns to keep the chill from the air during the cool season.</description>

    <description>Sweeping green lawns are well manicured and lovingly tended.  Leading into the distance, graceful headstones sport combinations of delicately scrawled words, stone cherubs, symbols and gargoyles.  The deep green of the grass contrasts with the light green of the ferns planted between some of the grave markers.  The fragrance of the flowers left by loved ones mingles with that of the blooming dogwoods, while weeping willows shade the tombstones.</description>

Several headstones lie alongside the path, including a heart-shaped one which attests to a couple who are joined in death as they were in life, while next to it, a tiny marker has been etched with the image of a smiling baby.

    <description>Shreds of ancient luxury still cling to the room, giving hints of the grandeur it must once have contained.  A large four-poster bed stands forlornly, missing its mattress and with only shreds of lace-trimmed pink silk to show where the canopy once hung.  The single window looks out not over the cliffs and what would be a spectacular view of the city, but toward the hillside rising up to the south, creating a curiously closed-in feeling.  An iron hook has been sunk into the stone wall next to the window.</description>
