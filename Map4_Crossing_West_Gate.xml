    <description>Well-worn paths lead through a grove of trees to a gate in The Crossing's western wall.  Now and again you hear birds calling to one another in the branches, or the bustling of a merchant's cart as it makes its way past.  A handful of adventurers nod at you in greeting as they make their way into town.  An aromatic mix of wildflowers mingles with wyndwood, oak and juniper trees as the grove stretches north and south, while to the west, you can see grassy flatlands through a small clearing.</description>

    <description>The path winds through a thick grove of trees running north and south along the walls of The Crossing.  The pleasant smell of flowers mixed with damp earth permeates the air, and birds sing cheerfully from their homes in the foliage.

You can see that it opens on all three farmhouse rooms -- a common enough practice in buildings that share a single heat source.  Only the passageway to the bedroom is open.</description>

    <description>A river-rock wall extends east to west, protecting the northern end of a rambling village.  The open village gate looks out across a vast stretch of the fields worked by the villagers.  A dirt pathway winds southward through a collection of cottages, shops and huts standing at odd angles, most with a fence or ditch fronting the path.  Farmers, returning from a day in the fields, find fellowship and food in the conveniently-located pub, The Pig's Pannage, its open doors just a short walk from the gate.</description>

    <description>Buildings thicken this area of the village, making it seem larger than it really is, but the forest still looms at the edges as a reminder that this is still nature's part of the world.  Hammers banging and the smell of tanning oils penetrate the air giving the feel of work and little leisure.  The occasional trader or inhabitant walk down the road, intent on their destination.</description>
    <description>Dark buildings clutter the side of the street, all silent and no sign of the constant work of day.  Lanterns hanging from posts along the road give a faint wavering light, throwing shadows that make the area look nearly as alive as during the working hours.</description>

    <description>A small building, structured from logs and mud, stands on the side of the road.  Skins hanging from the windows, and the smell of curing hides rolling out could almost dizzy the weak.  Here and to the west the road looks a bit more trodden indicating that this is the business area of the village.</description>

    <description>Happy sounds come from a building that seems to be the center of this area.  Decorated more than any other building here it has been painted a dark green with a red door.  People coming out look happy and content while people going in look anxious and excited.  A sign hanging over the doorway is welcoming and colorful, the sight as a whole could put a smile on the hardest of adventurers.</description>

    <description>Crudely constructed of rough-hewn planks, the stable appears as if it would fall over if pushed by a good wind.  An ancient pitchfork stands in the corner and leaning over it is an even more ancient Human, his body covered with old scars and puckered flesh.  The animals stabled here, contentedly munching their grain, seem untroubled by the disreputable state of the building.</description>

    <description>Heavy curtains block off the rest of the lodge from this small alcove.  A stern-looking clan guard stands alert, carefully scrutinizing each visitor before waving them through the curtains.  A young Barbarian boy, trying to sneak into the lodge, is caught by the guard, who lifts him up by the back of his shirt and gently sets him down outside.</description>

    <description>A beautiful clearing has seemingly been formed naturally in the middle of dense trees and brush.  The edges of the clearing look to be a barrier as sturdy as a wall yet unseen.  Lush grass bends softly with any stirring of the wind, and the occasional blue or red flower pop up giving splashing color to the green carpet.  In the middle a small stone pool has been built giving various birds of the area a water source for bathing and ridding of thirst.</description>

    <description>Crolin's purchasing room smells and looks like a disorganized slaughter-house.  The tanner, Crolin, inspects bundles of newly arrived skins, nodding or shaking his head after carefully working them with his hands. His rough, shrewd appearance seems to fit into the atmosphere perfectly.  Strong smells of dead animals and substances of the tanning trade drift through a door behind a stained and battered counter.</description>

    <description>Mounds of leather and hides find themselves stacked in almost every corner of this small work area.  Wooden boxes of metal rings, studs and rivets claim the remaining space, prompting Randal to use two rolls of padding as a make-shift seat because there is no further room for them.  Behind a wood counter Randal sits smiling to himself as he works on a leather breastplate.  A large hide tacked to the wall has something written on it.</description>

    <description>A gated order counter blocks passage into a large work room.  Behind the counter can be seen a worktable and a series of shelves holding a large assortment of tanned dry goods.  A half open window provides a welcome breath of relief from the stench that permeates the rest of Crolin's shop.  Crolin's wife Brigetta, an attractive, strong looking woman with slender calloused fingers, greets potential customers with a pleasant nod as they enter her domain.</description>

    <description>Work tables covered with different skins and tools take up most of the small room.  Small pools of sticky brown liquid gather at the edges of vats sitting against the wall.  Trapping equipment hangs from pegs on the wall, rusted and worn with years of use.  A window stands open offering the only ventilation against the stout fumes.</description>

    <description>The road runs straight and true through an area flanked by open grassland on one side, while a dark and foreboding stand of trees broods on the other.  To the south you catch a faint glimpse of a river beyond a ruined manor house.  Well-plowed fields to the west have now become thick grassland, heavily overgrown.  Green stalks tipped with long tassels flutter in the wind like ten thousand banners as a distant breeze ruffles the fields.</description>

    <description>The road forms a circular drive directly in front of what once was an elegant manor house.  Formal stone steps lead up to a sheltered porch.  An ornamental flower garden marks the eye of the circle, though it has long since gone to seed and weeds.  To the east, a thick copse of trees has grown into a tangled knot and grass rises, high and heavy, to the west.  Beyond the house, runs a small river.</description>

From a rounded roof hang dozens of bloated monsters.  Looking like enormous, pulsating sacks of flesh, they have vaguely insect-like heads with massive jaws that dig deep into the roof to hold them in place.  Enormous, distended guts pulsate slowly and through the thin chitin, you can make out faint shapes moving in some thick ooze.</description>

    <description>To the north, tall overgrown grassland blocks your view.  South, a line of willow trees, foliage long and dangling, obscures anything in that direction.  The high growth on all sides cuts off any hint of breeze and the air is thick and humid.  Clouds of gnats swarm and dart all about and their low drone washes over you, numbing your senses.  The ground squishes underfoot, dragging at your feet and making your footing uncertain.</description>

A grandfather of willow trees to judge from the thickness of the stump that remains.  A strange mold covers the ground here and every step sends small puffs of spores into the air.  Only the damp air keeps them from swirling high enough to be a threat to eyes or nose.</description>

Great stone columns steadfastly support a battered and weathered roof which has long since lost its shingles to the elements.  The rotted remnants of wooden railings hang limply between columns, having lived out their usefulness years ago.</description>

    <description>The path winds between giant oaks mixed in with a secondary growth of smaller trees of many types.  Your footsteps are hushed on a thick carpet of rotting leaves and pine needles.  The air is fresh with the smell of growing things and rich earth.  The only jarring note is an odd footprint in the dirt.  Of some size, it seems almost human but for its far longer toes ending in deep indentations that speak of non-human claws.</description>

Along the west edge of the quarry the dust of the day's work has settled upon the machines in a thick layer opposite piles of sorted material.  A cliff stands to the south, forming a tall backdrop to the scene.</description>
    <description>Workers sort the salvaged stone of the quarry into piles of similar size and color.  Along the west edge of the pit, stone is pounded and poured through stacked sieves to make various grades of sand and gravel.  Finished materials are stacked along the side of the quarry until needed, when they are slid down a large chute to the stone works.  Every few minutes, warning shouts precede a great tumbling of raw materials from a cliff to the south.</description>

    <description>The winds whip through the branches of the short, stunted trees up here on the ridge line.  It's uncomfortably cold, and eyes watering from the wind can't even properly appreciate the view.  Footing is good, since the wind has blown away loose stones and soil, leaving only what is well-anchored.</description>

    <description>The slope on this side of the outcrop is just barely navigable, about down to here.  The drop-off farther to the west is vertical, and the thought of climbing down it is unpleasant.  The view is spectacular, however, and the western lands spread out from one horizon to the other are awe-inspiring in their beauty and variety.</description>

    <description>This narrow notch between two huge rocks is home to nothing more complex than some yellowish grass and a bit of lacy grey moss that blends nearly invisibly into the stone.  Little light penetrates here, and the atmosphere is bare and gloomy.  The only positive note about this place is that the same rocks which shade it also block the winds.</description>

    <description>Lush green ferns line this hollow in the rock.  The soil is thicker here, with the dry bed of a tiny stream, probably carved by flowing rain water, running down from above and disappearing into a dry, cracked basin.

The deep, fertile soil of the forest is only a wish up here, where the ground is rocky and dry, with little loam in it.  Plants are smaller, tougher, and less colorful than down on the flatlands.</description>

Tough grass grows in the soil captured by cracks in the rock, and the roots of the plants pry, very slowly, at the stone, forcing it farther and farther apart.

    <description>Looking down from the crest of the rocky outcrop, the change of terrain between the rocks and the forest is obvious.  The dominant color on this side is grey -- grey rocks and grey-green foliage, spotted with occasional patches of dusty color where ever a plant has decided to put up flowers.  On the forest side the dominant color is a rich green, where lush trees and grass and ferns blend with larger and more colorful flowers.</description>

    <description>The biting winds draw tears to the eyes, but the view to the east is worth some discomfort.  Directly below stands a lush forest, spread out like a deep green ribbon with a silver thread of water running through it.  Patches of fields and orchards stretch from the edge of the wood to the eastern horizon, marred only by a tiny blotch of town.  Far to the east, the smoke from dozens, or perhaps even hundreds of fires rises into the air, forming a foggy haze.</description>
    <description>Strong winds howl through the blackness of the night, finding unimagined gaps in clothing and armor.  Spread to the east is only more blackness, but lit by a few lights, here and there.  One is relatively close, east and a bit south, a small flicker indicating a band or perhaps a small village.  Slightly larger is the flickering glow from farther east, about halfway from here to the horizon.  And on the horizon itself is a spot that lights up a patch of land as broad as an outstretched hand. </description>

    <description>From this vantage point, the deep crimson walls of the cliffs are visible as they plummet to the land below.  Their delicate, chalky appearance offers little confidence to those who prefer firmer ground.  Deep, vertical ruts give the impression of these cliffs being forced up from the world below, by an impressively strong -- or extremely angry -- godlike being.</description>

    <description>A large boulder with a massive crack through its middle, sits at this bend in the path.  The horrifying thing about it is that each mighty surge of wind sets it to shimmying ever so slightly.  It is unclear how many years this ungainly thing has perched in this place, and it is equally unclear where it came from, since its sparkling obsidian exterior looks nothing like the remainder of the area.</description>

    <description>Several fireflies dart about the limbs and branches, lighting this airy landing.  An outline of a hide can be seen stretched between two branches.  Scattered along the floor are several lumpy mounds and a shadowy string of skulls hang from a nearby branch.</description>

    <description>On top of this unsteady perch you have a view of the surrounding area.  Most directions are blocked by the heavy growth of trees, but the ruined chimneys of the manor poke above the treeline like broken teeth in a decaying mouth.  Not too far away, you catch a glimpse of the river that flows by the preserve.</description>

    <description>The walls of the lodge are covered with the hides and skins of many different animals.  You recognize the pelts of otter, fox, deer and wolf.  Despite the spacious size of the lodge, the air in the windowless building is thick and hazy.  You can smell the residue of an aromatic, heavy smoke.  A large firepit in the center of the room is placed below the ceiling's smoke hole.  A massive rack attached to one wall holds enough weapons for a small army.</description>

    <description>The air around the firepit is heavy with a sweet-smelling smoke.  A hole in the ceiling, directly above the pit, provides some relief with an occasional breeze.  Carved pipes and rattles made from gourds have been left on the dirt floor.  A tall barbarian warrior sits next to the fire, carefully attaching some eagle feathers to the end of a lance.</description>

    <description>Within the densely-packed timberland sits a round, flat arena hemmed by a circle of hewn logs.  Two additional logs have been set at opposite sides of this circle, each adorned with talismans of feathers and beads affixed to the skulls of wolves.  Beneath them, leather strips dyed in bright colors dance and flutter in the soft breeze.  The arena itself is composed of hard-packed dirt which bears the scars of innumerable steps, slides and turns executed in some kind of precise, battle-inspired dance.</description>

    <description>A single aged willow tree stands in the center of this wide clearing, its drooping boughs sway and creak, reaching for the ground.  This ancient symbol of death and rebirth shelters an open-air shrine that has been erected at the base of the tree's gnarled trunk.  Small tufts of broad-leafed hosta plants surround the shrine.  Impenetrable walls of densely-packed trees and brush cut off any exit except to the south.</description>

Taken together with the disturbed area within the bounds, the purpose of the improvised wrestling ground is clear.

To the north, a crater descends gently downward, encased in a veritable wall of snapping and writhing thorny vines that constantly churn the land and create an impassable barrier.  Extending upward into a vague teardrop pinnacle from which erupts a golden beam of light, the lifesculpted spire occupies the same space Knife Clan previously occupied.</description>

From here, a slightly different vantage of the maelstrom is afforded, and several gaps in the writhing vines reveal an encasement of malleable stone, which grows and crumbles as the living barrier continues its constant movement.  The pinnacle of the encasement terminates in a vaguely teardrop shape, and a beam of golden light shines upward.  Chunks of vine-encased stone are flung from the encasement, though they sink into the ground wherever they land, leaving little more than some gravel.</description>
