    <description>Yells and shouts fill the surroundings as dock workers communicate in the only way that is fitting for this noisy, hectic environment.  A couple young boys watch the work anxiously, planning their future and their torment.</description>
    <description>Though night turns the sea to black and turns the majority of Rathan citizens inside, work on the dock never seems to cease entirely as workers continue to ply their trade.</description>

The huge nests, woven from driftwood, seaweed and assorted debris, are clearly visible against the light color of the cliff's face.

Carters argue with sedan-chair bearers and small children and animals dart in and out amongst scurrying porters as they struggle to make sense of the maelstrom.  A harried civil official stands atop a small pillar in the center of it all, trying, and failing, to bring some order to the near-mob.</description>

    <description>Vendors of meat pies, tarts, and flavored ices stroll the crowded walk, calling out their wares in a sing-song rhythm that sticks in the memory.  Their cries blend with the splash of oars and the voice of the ocean wind to make a melody that identifies Ratha as clearly as a map or the high rock that juts from the harbor to the west.</description>
    <description>A flickering torch high on a post gives a bit of light to the walk.  A giant and misshapen shadow cast on the warehouse wall mimics the infrequent visitor to the docks at this time of night, and footsteps echo as if the shadow walked alongside.</description>

Elegantly clad men and women jostle for position among dock workers and common tradesmen in a vain attempt to speed their progress.  A trio of hawkers face off in a contest of lung power to lure in prospective clientele.  They seem blissfully unaware that they drive off far more potential business than they draw in.</description>

    <description>A high stone wall, meant to protect the street from wind and erosion, blends with the outer walls of an impressive home at the cliff's edge.  For several hundred paces along the roadway the old fortress towers, appearing abandoned, yet ever watchful.  Folks say that the Odalva family owns the property and that sometimes, late at night, strange activities can be observed in and around the mysterious manse.</description>

Above the table, vases filled with creamy white starflowers hang on either side of a painting of the late Josiah Jack Tarr.  Black gauze draped above the painting trails down to pool in soft heaps upon the floor.  Nearby, darkened oak stairs spiral down to the first floor.</description>

The gilded frames of the paintings which hang on the whitewashed walls gleam dully in the light.  Each painting depicts a ship on which Captain Josiah Tarr had served before his unfortunate death at sea.  A trapdoor in the ceiling leads up to the widow's walk on the top of the inn.</description>

A sour-faced Halfling woman, the painter has captured her expression perfectly, frozen in a perpetual glare at her husband's picture to the north.  Rumor has it that one of the incentives behind Captain Jack's many sea voyages was the lengthy time it gave him away from his wife.</description>

    <description>A thick oaken table dominates the center of this room and the skeleton of a small dog rests curled up on the middle of it.  Ash and partially burned logs lie scattered about the room but seem more concentrated in front of the open wood-burning stove sitting in a corner.  All of the cabinets have fallen off the walls, leaving shattered dishes and flatware strewn about the floor as well.  A large window looks north onto a garden overgrown with weeds.</description>

    <description>The smell of refuse and molding linen clings to the still air in this loft.  Scattered piles of composting cloth are nested about the room, giving the impression that the space was once inhabitable.  Tattered grey curtains dangle from the west side of the ceiling, ending just above a shoddy ladder leading to the living quarters down below.  The south wall of the loft has collapsed, leaving an opening to the desolate street below.  A collection of rotting wood figurines lies jumbled in a corner.</description>

Giant guards flank the doors, immobile as if cast from stone.  The portico itself spreads across the front of the palace offering cool shade from the heat of the day.  Several fountains spout from bronze grotesques set into the wall, their streams running down into stone basins where the traveler may quench a thirst or lave dusty feet.</description>

    <description>Filigree iron stairs spiral around a large wooden pole reminsicent of a ship's mast.  A polished deobar railing is carved with images of ravens and raccoons which intertwine around anchors, mining picks and the crest of the Nadamian family.  Dark aged oak carved into the shape of a leaping welkin forms the newel post to anchor the railing to the steps at the bottom and top of each section.</description>

    <description>Brightly illuminated lanterns hang from tall iron poles forming pools of warm amber light along the sandstone path.  The crystal dome of the inn glows against the black velvet night sky.</description>
    <description>Pale grey sandstone bricks create a smooth passage toward an elegant inn to the northeast.  Travelers casually rest upon cool white marble benches beneath the towering palm trees throughout the lush terraced gardens.  Shell-pink granite walls rise above the trees to the red clay tiled roof of the building.</description>

    <description>Moths flitter at globe-like lanterns that sit nestled along the gravel paths creating small pools of flickering light.  The sweet scent of wisteria wafts through the night air on the slightest breeze.  Among the dim shadows, the outline of a small structure appears to sit in the center of a mirror image of the starry velvet sky.</description>
    <description>A walk through this shady garden can be a rewarding side trip.  Stately trees form green walls along winding gravel paths that bisect the gardens from large expanses of manicured green lawns.  At the crossroads is a white gazebo surrounded by three symmetrical reflecting pools.  Standing on a small moss covered mound, the little structure seems to blush in the sunlight.  Stepping stones create a path through the clear pools to the small marble structure.</description>

Tall open archways of the building's facade can partially be seen through lush gardens that cover the face of the inn.</description>

    <description>The obvious end of the tunnel is a shrine to the goddess Eylhaar.  A featureless statue, somewhat feminine in nature but with a hint of masculinity, stands next to a gnarled doorway.  The feeling of death hangs in the air, but is one of a more peaceful, natural death.  The walls themselves are etched with memorials of those who have died and may be buried here.</description>

    <description>Away from the elegance of the bank's public areas, two burly guards with a no-nonsense air about them protect the iron-lined exchange vault.  Liveried tellers glide in and out, handing leather pouches to the guards, who in turn pass the coins through a flickering moongate at the far end of the room.  On one side, a languid S'Kra Mur Moon Mage reclines upon a plush quilted silk divan as she concentrates upon maintaining her part of the network of gates used by the bank.</description>

A wide stairway leads downward, further into the society, while a large waste bucket rests nearby.</description>
