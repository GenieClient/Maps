    <description>Overhead, sea plants woven into a mat spread from pillars of coral to provide shade for the visiting land folk.  Small glass and crystal globes hang from the pillars.  Underfoot, the smooth sandstone is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  Columns and domes rise up from the water surrounding the dock.  Cargo is being brought in by Merelew workers and then stacked on the dock for sorting.</description>
    <description>Overhead, glowing crystal globes shed a soft green-yellow light on the dock.  Tall coral pillars rise from the sandstone to provide anchorage for the awning overhead.  The smooth sandstone of the dock is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  In the water, glowing points of light give a glimpse of the true Merelew city.  Soft breezes blow through the pillars, and in the darkness, the sound of the sea murmurs unchanged.</description>

    <description>Signs of hasty construction abound -- from the rough edges of the timbers to the occasional nailhead not sunk completely into the wood.  An awning has been erected on the west side of the extension, helping to shelter visitors from the setting sun while they await entry into the festival.  A small sign is tacked to one of the awning's poles, its painted lettering showing haste with the drips running down the front of the plank.</description>

    <description>Coral pillars rise from the sandstone of the dock to provide anchorage for a woven mat overhead.  The smooth sandstone slabs of the dock are decorated with interlocking circles made from corals, shells, and gold.  Crates soar in neat stacks, each labeled with the names of famous trading houses.  A few bear the seal of the Merelew, indicating that they are being shipped landside.  A group of Halflings moves cargo about.</description>
    <description>Coral pillars seem to twist upward in the soft green-yellow light of the crystal globes.  Underfoot, the dock is decorated with swirling patterns of coral, shell, and gold.  Neatly stacked in rows are boxes and bales of cargo.  Rising on the hill with the lights sparkling like gleaming gems in the night is the Merelew city, while gazing into the water more lights can be seen.</description>

    <description>Deobar railings decorated with carved dolphins separate the polished ebonwood deck from the sea.  Rising from the central cabin is the ship's tall ironwood mast, standing with sails furled.  Access aft is provided by a pair of narrow walkways leading around the cabin, while a locked deobar gate blocks further forward progress.  A lone Halfling crewman works to apply a new coat of oil and wax to the deck.</description>

The captain, who is sitting in an ebonwood chair inlaid with bits of shell and carved with flowers, watches five of the Halfling crew play a game of cards.  Hanging from the ship's wheel is a wine flask.  Forward access is provided by two walkways that lead around the main cabin.

    <description>Soft green-yellow light falls across the limestone and coral dock.  Crates, bales, boxes, and assorted cargo stand in quiet rows waiting for the dawn.

Maces and scimitars line the walls, along with multi-colored decorations for heroism.  A few also write reports, inspect cabinets for merchandise, and study a roster on the wall.  A Merelew guard captain looks on quietly, taking in all the activity without comment.</description>

Hovering among the stacks of merchandise, a Merelew merchant in green silks and an Elf in blue brocade bargain over an open box of pearls.</description>

Low buildings of sandstone, decorated with coral and pearlescent shell panels, alternate with tall coral pillars along the route.  A basalt statue faces a marble statue across the way, the icons mostly ignored as passersby stroll north toward the Palace domes or south to the docks.</description>

Standing before the archway is a coral tree, shaped like a great deobar.  Under the branches are benches for people to stop and rest.  On both sides are fountains of sandstone decorated with coral.  The sounds of the water gurgling in the fountains and of the wind blowing through the tree can be heard.</description>
    <description>The road ends at a sandstone and coral archway.  Soft green-yellow light shed from crystal globes illuminates a coral tree in the middle of the road.

    <description>The walkway is lined with a plentiful supply of granite chips, covered with glowing yellow algae.  Several sawhorses protect pedestrians from falling into a large gaping hole in the walkway.  Glimmering, golden-winged insects buzz about them, humming softly and exuding a slight scent of myrrh.  Andreshlew traders and officials stop in their rounds to admire them, breathing in the heavy air with evident delight.  Further to the southwest is a purple-domed spire, while a raised platform lies to the northeast.</description>

    <description>A curved spire constructed entirely from violet cinnabar dominates this arm of the starfish.  It has been carved into an endless, vermicular relief of stylized claws and dragons' heads.  Mummified arms and hands, swathed in indigo gauze, frame a diamond-shaped doorway.  A single lambent ruby occupies its summit, set in a wattled circular brass frame that resembles an eye.  Wide and round at its base and entryway, the spire swiftly narrows into a single, slender support that reaches for the sky.</description>
