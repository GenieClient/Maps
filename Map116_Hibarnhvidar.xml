    <description>The few lackluster stands that line the road in this spot seek to make their fortunes on quantity instead of quality.  Fights erupt between the merchants -- to the delight of those stuck in traffic -- and constant price wars eliminate profits more often than not.  Nailed to a signpost erected on the low side of the road is a painted sign whose message smeared into oblivion when the letters ran in the rain.</description>

    <description>Semi-precious stones set in the facade of arches beneath the balcony reflect the true Dwarven style of opulence.  A garland of amethyst jadice flowers graces the northwest arch while to the west white topaz forms the Haakish word awdh.  To the southwest three rings interlock -- one of bloodstone, lapis, and jade, the second of onyx, topaz and hematite, and the wide third band is gold.</description>

    <description>The merchants set beneath the balconies preempt the ornate architecture of this cavern.  Set in the tympanum of the arch to the northeast is an ornate enameled shield, while the eastern arch depicts a locked vault such as one would use to store valuables.  When the gate to the northwest opens, a slight breeze sets the candles lighting the cavern flickering and creates the illusion of movement by the fashionably dressed Dwarves who linger over the southwest arch.</description>

Suspended at all levels, some of the candelabra appear almost within reach, while others are high overhead near the cavern's ceiling.  The only shadows are cast by the carved alabaster balustrade along the balcony's edge.</description>

Huge kettles stand at intervals, empty now but ready to be filled with boiling oil in the event of war.  Only a single lonely guard patrols during peacetime, occasionally leaning back against the wall and enjoying a good smoke of a pipe almost as big as his head.</description>

Thatch-roofed cottages lean against sturdy slate-roofed shops and warehouses, and whitewashed stucco mingles with brick and stonework.  Looking straight down the Great Gate Road, the rows of menhirs lining it to either side resemble grey soldiers standing at attention.</description>

A curving pathway has been coaxed out of the stone and winds lazily around the large terraced cavern.

As the Dwarves come and go, they stop by the racks of Dwarven axes, spears, and swords that line the sides of the armory, carefully inspecting the weaponry and replacing those that have been damaged during their sparring exercises.  In the event of threat from the outside, there can be little doubt that the Dwarves will defend the homes that line the cavern.</description>

Thick beams criss-cross the ceiling, and solid pillars -- looking as though they were made of whole tree trunks -- march along all four walls.  The wood is a medium shade, neither oppressively dark nor so light as to appear freshly cut, and has been lovingly polished until it glows.</description>

Day or night, whether sun or moon, natural or Dwarf-made, the beautiful rainbow of light illuminates the cavern, shining directly onto a gleaming white quartz altar.</description>

An easel in the corner displays another picture, of which the artist is either proud, or lacks wall space for display.</description>

    <description>Ranging through all the fiery shades of yellow, orange and red, the natural variance in color of the stone walls resembles dancing flames.  An unusual piping song whispers through the area, occasionally falling quiet at irregular intervals.  The source of the haunting music is a series of hollowed sticks fashioned into flutes and cleverly secured by the arched entry to catch any gusts of air.</description>

    <description>Sturdy shelves behind the long wooden counter hold a variety of tools needed by the members of the society, all neatly stored away for easy access.  A burly looking Dwarf stands behind the counter, his beady eyes missing nothing that happens in the chamber.</description>

    <description>Thick tapestries cover the walls, obscuring the stone the chamber was carved from.  Papers are piled on the desk in haphazard stacks, threatening to spill over the floor at any moment.  Swatches of cloth and design sketches fill a small rolling cart next to the desk, ready for the next project.</description>

    <description>Scents of oils, ash, and other unidentifiable odors waft through the entryway, drifting from deeper within the Society.  A passageway to the east leads to the master's office, while a wider tunnel in the south wall provides access to the rest of the working areas.  A few chairs, battered from much use, sit on the polished stone floor.</description>

Occupying the back third of the room is a solid-looking loom, while a large spinning wheel sits near the entrance.  Resting atop a deep purple rug is a sturdy worktable and a comfortable, wicker chair.  Running parallel along opposing walls are several hooks and shelves, holding practically every conceivable tool, spool of thread, bobbin, thimble and scrap.</description>

The white walls have seen better days, and black and grey scuff marks adorn much of the open space.  A large workstation along one wall is unnaturally free of clutter and holds several organized tools and implements.

A colorful mural covers the wall behind the counter, depicting brawny dwarves at work at a variety of tasks.  Vast, countless rows of differently sized shelves are behind the counter, and complex Dwarven mechanisms can be heard as they rearrange the package-covered storage.  Clerks shuffle endlessly back and forth between the counters and shelving as they assist patrons with their packaging and mailing needs.</description>
