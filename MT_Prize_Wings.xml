    <description>Subdued lighting illuminates the tasteful wooden paneling of the room while a bevy of overstuffed furniture provides comfortable seating for those contemplating weighty choices.  Thick plush carpets in a myriad of hues cover the floor, almost totally obscuring the pale wooden planks of the flooring.  Around the walls, a number of colored archways contain magical portals that, when open, allow access to the prize rooms beyond.  A large set of double doors allows access to rooms devoted to dispenser activities while a round opening leads to the area devoted to workshops for alterations.</description>
