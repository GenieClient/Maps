[Haalikshal Highway, Ferry Dock] (113-6)
An ample dock lies in an elbow of the river, and to its stones is fastened the stout chain that guides the ferry.  Although many a fisherman would like to tie his punt or rowboat here, the ferrymen fend them off, warning them against fouling the tow-line or, with more urgency, against getting caught between the heavy timbers of the ferry and the stones of the dock.

[The Damaris' Kiss] (113-13)
Long and low, the sleek lines of the ferry are designed so that it slips through the water with a minimum of disturbance.  Benches are scattered along the railing, with gaps where the Gor'Tog polemen stand to push the boat across the river.  Cables run up to a massive chain strung from shore to shore just overhead, providing a leash to keep the ferry from being pushed downriver by the strong current.

You come to a very soft stop as the ferry reaches the dock.  The ferrymaster mumbles a few quick words of thanks as he and his crew move to unload the supplies.
A crew member points towards the exit and you make your way off.

[Ain Ghazal, Ferry Dock] (113-8)
Hard packed ground is littered with barrels, boxes and various conveyances awaiting the ferries' return to dock.  Smooth rock benches are scattered around the large area, for those travelers wishing to wait off their feet.  The dock itself is crafted from dark wood and braced by huge rocks and beams, while iron lanterns blaze from poles hung along each side.

[Ain Ghazal, East Pier]
Subtle light gleams from bronze lanterns hung from a couple of tall poles, leaving shadows along a wood pier that juts off from the hard packed ground.  The pier provides a sturdy transition from road to river conveyance, with its beams wide enough for large beasts to go safely aboard.  The river's brisk waters beat against the rocks below with a wild rhythm, while a sign nearby warns of their danger.
You also see a highly polished skiff and a side pier.

[A Birch Skiff] (113-2)
This particular skiff is roomy and solid with benches only slightly worn from use.  A lantern is hung at one end, shining its light against the surrounding darkness.  It makes a slight jingling noise as it sways along with the boat.

The skiff just started its trip.  The elves are not about to turn around just to let you off.

[Ilaya Taipa, Baso Dock] (113-1)
The harbor wall towers high above the Baso, or Stranger's, dock.  While the interior town walls are elaborately carved and even highlighted with vivid, jewel-toned enamel, the outer have been smoothed as sheer as the stonemason's art can make them, providing no cracks where climbers could make their way up.  Foreign merchants must dock here to take on or offload cargo, or to pick up passengers for the trip up the river.
You also see a highly polished skiff and some heavy oak doors in the harbor wall.
Obvious paths: none.



The skiff lightly taps the dock and the skilled River Elf crew quickly secure the skiff to the pilings.

["Kertigen's Honor"]
[Southern Trade Route, Segoltha South Bank]
The southern bank of the Segoltha River presents a wide, flat flood plain far to the east and west.  The alluvial soil here is deep brown and fertile, nourished by the unpredictable rains that cause the river to rise rapidly and without warning.  Off in the distance to the south, you can spy the crests of trees.  This marks the boundary of the Endrus Forest, which surrounds the fabled Elven stronghold of Leth Deriel.
You also see the Mistbringer, Rose Huntress, the Bloody Dawg, the Sunflower, the Maverick, the Rissan Revenge, the Wandering Fae, the ferry Kertigen's Honor and Alfren's Tollbridge.
Obvious paths: south.

The Captain stops you and requests a transportation fee of 35 kronars as you board the craft.
You hand him your kronars and climb aboard.
["Kertigen's Honor"]
The ferry rocks gently as you step aboard.  Surrounded by the cool, briny air of the Segoltha, you take your place on the deserted deck and gaze up into the night sky.
You also see the south bank docks.

A few weary travelers lean against a railing at the bow of this ferry, anxiously waiting to reach the opposite bank.  An elderly S'Kra Mur stands alone at the stern, thoughtfully watching the shallow wake of the ferry shiver and become still.
You also see the south bank docks.

[The Crossing, Alfren's Ferry]
Alfren's Ferry is a privately owned and operated ferry that carries folks over the broad and swift Segoltha River.  The ferry does a brisk business, since the trade route to the Elven forest reaches lies south across the river.  In the face of hostile assaults, the river serves as a formidable barrier.
You also see a pile of rocks, Lemicus Square, the ferry Hodierna's Grace and a news stand.

[Salt Yard, Barge Dock] (30-82)
The end of the dock is reinforced with heavy timbers and rusting iron plates, no doubt to compensate for the extreme weight of the high piles of salt sacks.  Strategically hidden between the stacks are crates and leather satchels, their shipping labels designating their contents as decidely non-salty in origin.  None of the items appear to be black-market goods, so why such lengths were taken to disguise their transport is not clear.
You can see a barge nearing the dock.
You also see the barge Riverhawk.

One of the barge's crew members stops you and requests a transportation fee of 120 Lirums as you board the craft.  You hand him your Lirums and climb aboard.
THIS ROOM IS NOT EVEN ON THE MAPS
["The Riverhawk"]
The deck of the wooden barge is mostly covered with tightly packed crates and barrels, all tied down so as not to tumble about or fall overboard during the sometimes turbulent river journeys.  A hatch on the deck leads to the belly of the barge, where additional cargo is stored for shipment, but the entry is barred by a heavy chain to prevent tampering with valuables.  Tracks of mud are everywhere upon the boat.
Obvious paths: north.


The barge pulls into dock and its crew quickly ties the barge off.

[Stone Docks, Covered Shore]
Barely extending from the shore, the dock is little more than a short series of solid blocks of weather-battered stone.  Thick sheets of canvas are lashed in a tent-like fashion around this port, keeping the onslaught of the skies and winds at bay while also serving to mask its presence from passing ships.  With the excessive vegetation that creates yet another disguising layer outside the canvas, it's clear that many boats could pass along the Faldesu without ever knowing this place exists.
You also see the barge Riverhawk and a brushy break in the undergrowth.
Obvious exits: south.

The eastern end of Riverhaven's docks juts out into the river, servicing schooners heading out into the Reshal Sea.  The pier is eerily silent, few ships making the dangerous night passage up the Faldesu River with the lighthouse out of commission.
You also see the Open Grave, the White Water Paladin, the Skegikmewr, Treasure Seeker, the Maiden's Kiss, the Star's Grace, Serenity, the Black Storm, Rolling Thunder, Mazrian's Last Dance, the Bloodworm Comet, the Midnight Ruby, a news stand, the Kree'la's schedule, the Lybadel's schedule, an ebony slate, a white slate and a shipping office door.

The ferry "Her Opulence" pulls up to the dock.
roomname: Riverhaven, Ferry Dock (30-103)
roomtitle: ["Her Opulence"] (30-103)
Long, wide and low, this vessel is built for utility, but the hand of luxury can be discerned in the ornately carved walnut railings, down-cushioned benches and the well polished deck.  Six lanterns along the ferry's rail fill the boat with a soft light, creating a feeling of closure from the surrounding blackness.
You also see the Riverhaven docks.
You also see the North Road docks.

A slab of downed cedars, lashed together, rides upon the Faldesu River forming the landing for the ferry's patrons.  The nearby splash of a toad and the squawk of distant waterfowl own this place, until the new day brings the drumming of civilization.

Surrounded by surrealistic calm, this furthest edge of the pier stops almost a third of the way into the river.  Large, dark moorings stand like blackened sentinels at its edge, waiting for the arrival of the massive barges which service this port.
You also see a shipment board.

A small removable slate reads:

roomname: Langenfirth, Wharf (40-36)
roomtitle: [Langenfirth, Wharf] (40-36)
The waters of the Gwenalion lap gently against the pilings beneath this rickety pier.  Huge gaps in the broken wood let up tangy scents of damp peat mixed with a distinctively colorful yet indeterminate odor.  Swathed in silence and darkness, the wharf seems derelict and abandoned, hardly suggestive of the activity which takes place upon it when the sun touches the sky.
You also see the barge Northern Pride, a public notice sign and a news stand.

One of the barge's crew members stops you and requests a transportation fee of 65 lirums as you board the craft.

roomtitle: ["Northern Pride", Main Deck]
This is the only barge of its type to ply the waters of Lake Gwenalion.  Ambitiously designed with an upper deck for passengers, its aft is completely given over to cargo.  Built recently, everything about it smacks of economy and minimalism.

The first of the massive barges to traverse Lake Gwenalion, "Theren's Star" still maintains a quiet elegance despite its apparent age.  The utilitarian deck upon which casual travelers walk is spartan, but the decking is made of expensive tabor wood felled from far southern forests.  An oval doorway leads down to the barge's cargo bay, while an elaborately-carved wooden door provides ingress to the comfortably appointed lounge.

The greying wooden boards of the platform have been replaced by paving stones.  Two massive granite pillars offer support for a set of thick rope cables that allow the gondola served by this platform to cross the chasm.  Stacks of building stones and mortar lie off to one side, ready to add to the structure being raised around the landing.
You also see a door frame.

Like an aerie forgotten in the wilderness, the platform remains despite being abandoned by its creators.  While rickety and creaking uneasily, it appears to have held up well.  Two side-by-side granite beams rise up from the edge of the ridge, around which have been wound the lengths of rope used by the gondola that provides transport over the great chasm.
You also see a granite plaque, a weathered wooden gondola and the ridge.

Painted to a deep mist-twilight color, this tiny cab creaks to itself, an eerie and disconcerting sound.  Seats flow out of the sides and bottom of the gondola, set there by lifesculptors who have been long forgotten.  The light hardly pierces the tinted windows, leaving this place feeling all the more isolated and chillingly empty.

roomname: Gondola, Cab South (998-39)
roomtitle: [Gondola, Cab South] (998-39)
Mottled stains are worked into the wooden floor and seats of this small cab, darkening the windows to a thick black opacity.  A spike of chill taints the air, the thinnest strand of some sickly-sweet metallic scent wrapping it.

With a soft bump, the gondola comes to a stop at its destination.
You notice you've arrived and you make your way off.

Beyond the harbor, spray is thrown high into the air as waves strike the enclosing reef.  The crash of the surf on the coral alternates with a long, drawn-out hiss as each retreating wave regroups to try again.  From the vantage of the pier, several breaks in the reef are visible, but it would take an experienced and daring captain to attempt them.
