[Haalikshal Highway, Ferry Dock] (113-6)
An ample dock lies in an elbow of the river, and to its stones is fastened the stout chain that guides the ferry.  Although many a fisherman would like to tie his punt or rowboat here, the ferrymen fend them off, warning them against fouling the tow-line or, with more urgency, against getting caught between the heavy timbers of the ferry and the stones of the dock.

[The Damaris' Kiss] (113-13)
Long and low, the sleek lines of the ferry are designed so that it slips through the water with a minimum of disturbance.  Benches are scattered along the railing, with gaps where the Gor'Tog polemen stand to push the boat across the river.  Cables run up to a massive chain strung from shore to shore just overhead, providing a leash to keep the ferry from being pushed downriver by the strong current.

Mapped exits: go dock, go dock

You come to a very soft stop as the ferry reaches the dock.  The ferrymaster mumbles a few quick words of thanks as he and his crew move to unload the supplies.
A crew member points towards the exit and you make your way off.

[Ain Ghazal, Ferry Dock] (113-8)
Hard packed ground is littered with barrels, boxes and various conveyances awaiting the ferries' return to dock.  Smooth rock benches are scattered around the large area, for those travelers wishing to wait off their feet.  The dock itself is crafted from dark wood and braced by huge rocks and beams, while iron lanterns blaze from poles hung along each side.
You also see the Damaris' Kiss.

[Ain Ghazal, East Pier]
Subtle light gleams from bronze lanterns hung from a couple of tall poles, leaving shadows along a wood pier that juts off from the hard packed ground.  The pier provides a sturdy transition from road to river conveyance, with its beams wide enough for large beasts to go safely aboard.  The river's brisk waters beat against the rocks below with a wild rhythm, while a sign nearby warns of their danger.
You also see a highly polished skiff and a side pier.
>go skiff
A highly polished skiff has just left.  You will have to wait for the next skiff.

As you move to board the bateau, the captain stops you and says, "In order to ride along you will need to pay 58 dokoras."
  You hand him your dokoras and climb aboard.

[A Birch Skiff] (113-2)
This particular skiff is roomy and solid with benches only slightly worn from use.  A lantern is hung at one end, shining its light against the surrounding darkness.  It makes a slight jingling noise as it sways along with the boat.
You also see the Baso Dock.
Obvious paths: none.
Mapped exits: go dock, go dock

>go dock
The skiff just started its trip.  The elves are not about to turn around just to let you off.

[Ilaya Taipa, Baso Dock] (113-1)
The harbor wall towers high above the Baso, or Stranger's, dock.  While the interior town walls are elaborately carved and even highlighted with vivid, jewel-toned enamel, the outer have been smoothed as sheer as the stonemason's art can make them, providing no cracks where climbers could make their way up.  Foreign merchants must dock here to take on or offload cargo, or to pick up passengers for the trip up the river.
You also see a highly polished skiff and some heavy oak doors in the harbor wall.
Obvious paths: none.



The skiff lightly taps the dock and the skilled River Elf crew quickly secure the skiff to the pilings.
(GOOD TO EXIT)
"Get your things, folks," the captain belts out, "We won't be staying here more than two roisaen and then it's back to the river."

["Kertigen's Honor"]
[Southern Trade Route, Segoltha South Bank]
The southern bank of the Segoltha River presents a wide, flat flood plain far to the east and west.  The alluvial soil here is deep brown and fertile, nourished by the unpredictable rains that cause the river to rise rapidly and without warning.  Off in the distance to the south, you can spy the crests of trees.  This marks the boundary of the Endrus Forest, which surrounds the fabled Elven stronghold of Leth Deriel.
You also see the Mistbringer, Rose Huntress, the Bloody Dawg, the Sunflower, the Maverick, the Rissan Revenge, the Wandering Fae, the ferry Kertigen's Honor and Alfren's Tollbridge.
Obvious paths: south.

The Captain stops you and requests a transportation fee of 35 kronars as you board the craft.
You hand him your kronars and climb aboard.
["Kertigen's Honor"]
The ferry rocks gently as you step aboard.  Surrounded by the cool, briny air of the Segoltha, you take your place on the deserted deck and gaze up into the night sky.
You also see the south bank docks.

>go ferry
[Assuming you mean the ferry Kertigen's Honor.]
The ferry has just pulled away from the dock.  You will have to wait for the next one.

["Hodierna's Grace"]0
A few weary travelers lean against a railing at the bow of this ferry, anxiously waiting to reach the opposite bank.  An elderly S'Kra Mur stands alone at the stern, thoughtfully watching the shallow wake of the ferry shiver and become still.
You also see the south bank docks.
Also here: Neston.

The ferry Hodierna's Grace reaches the dock and its crew ties the ferry off.
A crew member points towards the exit and you make your way off.
[The Crossing, Alfren's Ferry]
Alfren's Ferry is a privately owned and operated ferry that carries folks over the broad and swift Segoltha River.  The ferry does a brisk business, since the trade route to the Elven forest reaches lies south across the river.  In the face of hostile assaults, the river serves as a formidable barrier.
You also see a pile of rocks, Lemicus Square, the ferry Hodierna's Grace and a news stand.
