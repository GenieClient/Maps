# fixed a run condition between being inviso at the shard gate (STOP.INVIS) and (MOVE.INVIS)

#2022-09-22
# Hanryu - powerwalk smoother/ranger blend
# - if you're powerwalking, set typeahead to 0, once you're done powerwalking, set it back to $automapper.typeahead global
# - added release blend for rangers
# - added ...wait checkes to a few matches that were missing them
# - fixed trigger for dropping your feature hiding cloak
# - moved a bunch of the pauses to >pause %command_pause

# June 25, 2022 - TenderVittle's Touches:
# Added variable action gosub to handle doing commands you really want to make sure are done right. This is a toggle.
# Added a toggle for collecting rocks on the ice road vs. just waiting.
# Redid skate/footwear logic from scratch. Tested a lot. Does not take skates off if you stop at room 45 (going north) or only move one room (so don't do that.)
# Removed broom/carpet messaging from retry action, and removed double from fail action. Now its only a fail action. Not sure if that breaks things for broom/carpet users, sorry.
# Removed unused MOVE.POWER routine.
# Removed unused MOVE.PAUSE routine and action.
# Adjusted tab spacing throughout the whole script.
# Set all labels to caps for half-blind people like me to tell them apart. Also added spacing between labels.
# Compressed single-line code blocks { } where it seemed safe to do so.
# Made MOVE.RETRY.GO's stunned check return to MOVE.RETRY.GO instead of MOVE.RETRY
# Moved some labels around for flow.
# Added Steps of Vuan to Moon Mage spell release for invisibility movement
# Redid feature-hiding cloak logic for Shard gates. Now supports multiple nouns and will attempt to re-hide your face and such after passing through/before detouring.
# Added echo to short pause movements like the root in the southwest of Leth Deriel's map, to indicate the script/Genie is not freezing there.
# Re-wrote and absorbed many helper scripts. Not all thoroughly tested, however. "sharddetour", "peerchurch", "infusionentry" and "crossingtrainerfix" are still required in your scripts folder.
# Added logic for Misenseor Abbey's secret hatchway. Needs more testing, and the map updated to replace "go secret hatchway" with "script abbeyhatch".
#
# - Updated Stow Foot logic trigger - Removed Old Obsolete Regex Trigger since stow foot logic now in game
# - Added missing match for MOVE_RETRY (for climbing in Abandoned Mine)
# - Updated stow foot logic to handle prayer mats
# - Added move_PAUSE routine for better handling of walking through areas with long RT causing automapper to trip up on itself
# - Added support for getting ice skates from portal bag as a secondary check
# Shroom - Updated matches for closed shops in Shard
# 1 - to work with shops in Shard that let you in at night when you ARE a citizen (was exiting out before instead of continuing)
# 2 - to properly exit out when you get the message and are NOT a citizen
# Added standing checks before quitting automapper
# Increased wait time on Ice as was going too fast in some cases
# Added Special Support for the Stone Wall in Cragstone Vale
# Fixed a bug in the Retry Logic

# July 17 2022 - Shroom
# Fixed bug in Move_Stow
# Added standing checks before moving wall in gear gate bypass

# VTCifer -  Changed default debug level at the top to be more useful
# Fixed whitespace
# Added match for powerwalk
# Added missing script label
# Fixed wait time for ice
#
# 2019-09-25 - Shroom - Robustified Shard gate logic - should take detour if rejected by guard (requires .sharddetour script)
# Cleaned up the ice skate logic
# 2019-08-6 Shroom - Added several missing matches
# Dasffion - Added in a waiteval for depth on climbing to allow the script to catch up on type aheads.

# 2019-07-06 - VTCifer - Reverted most "send" commands to "put", to prevent out of order commands
# 2019-06-19 - VTCifer - Updated foot slot routine from Dasffion
# Changed default typeahead to 1 (standard for accounts) and cleaned up documentation of setting

# 2019-4-20 - Shroom - Cleaned up retry logic - added micro pauses to reduce errors
# Added trigger logic for being invisible and unable to enter certain areas - should drop invis and retry

# 2018-7-21 - Shroom - Fixed stowfootitem routine, fixed powerwalking routine
# Cleaned up some matchres, spacing, optimized some code with help of Pelic
# 2018-7-28 - Added missing match for closed shop. Cleaned up some RegEx thanks to Ataeleos

# 2017-11-13 - Shroom - Synced changes and updates from TF and Prime versions -  To make compatible across both instances

# 2016-12-01 - Shroom - Added updates and optimizations

# Added additional catches for closed shops
# Added support for knocking on a town gate (Shard) during Night to get in. (Need to add checks for Non-Citizens, may cause problems with non-citizens)
