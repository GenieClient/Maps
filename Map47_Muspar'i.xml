    <description>Gauzy blue sunshades far above reach out from building eaves on either side of the way, shifting in slight desert breezes and shading the daytime strollers below.  An inn to one side has seen better days, but still seems to do a brisk business with all the traffic.  The constant crowd of the street makes it difficult going for merchant caravans on their way to the Great Gate to the southeast.</description>
    <description>The sound of fabric flapping in the night breezes comes down to the street from somewhere overhead, beyond the range of sight.  An inn to one side has seen better days, but still looks well off with what customers it manages to attract.  The crowds of the day have dissipated, leaving only the occasional patron stepping into the inn for the night.</description>

    <description>Whitewashed walls seem to pull the light down into the street, throwing small but sharp shadows away from people and objects.  Ignoring the traffic of everyday life passing upon the way, a cat naps upon the front step of a building.  A wall topped with slate blue tiles separates the Carousel Square from the staho, but no gate blocks the wide archway leading through the wall to the square.</description>

Here the soft stone shows its age, with hairline cracks running across the occasional wall or storefront, some extending from the ground below to the crest of the structure several stories overhead.</description>
    <description>Deep darkness engulfs the southern sector of this pathway, shadows from the tall (and often mismatched) buildings made unforgiving by the cloak of night.  All is silent, a rare lack of sound in the normally bustling city, as the structures that normally provide forgiving shade now swallow both sound and light.</description>

A rhythmic beat that pulses with the heart keeps a constant undertone to travelers' shifting feet.</description>

Having paid homage to the noble S'Kra depicted, they continue on their way, returning their attentions to the crowds that gather to watch the never-ending sideshows.  A display of paintings are sheltered under the awning of a nearby building.  The budding artist hovers protectively in front of the oils as he hawks his greatest works.</description>

    <description>A set of iron lamps has been hung from tripods to illuminate the dark flagstones between the gate and the stair for those that might traverse the courtyard.  Those that wander beyond the soft glow of the lamps have nothing more than the dim light that seeps down into the enclosure to show them the way across the bare stone.</description>
    <description>Darkly colored flagstones pave the courtyard, swept clean of any desert sands that may have blown in.  The featureless stones leave no cover for any intruder that might have breached the gate of the old fort, giving the arrow slits high up on the walls an ominous character.  A wide set of stone stairs leads up to the main entrance of the old keep.</description>

Equally lofty windows flank the door with their aged iron shutters propped open, permitting a view of the flagstone courtyard and the passage of breezes rather than footsteps.  Passageways lead both ways around the immutable stone core, drawing the visitor further into the old keep.</description>

Potted plants scattered through the area reveal their value by displaying a gorgeous set of night-blooming flowers that fill the air with their heady scents.  The great shaft overhead shares the scent with the rest of the keep, distributing it on the gentle breeze that drifts up throughout the building.</description>
    <description>A few potted plants have been placed around the room to catch what light they can from the wide open shaft above them that runs up through the entire height of the keep.  Far overhead at the top of the shaft are a set of skylights and mirrors to draw light down into the interior of the keep.  The noticeable breeze here stands as evidence that the shaft provides ventilation for the building as well.</description>

From somewhere in the darkness comes a delicate floral scent that wanders with the cool air.  The mirrors that reflect light down into the well during the day are little more than shadowy shapes that linger beneath the skylights, which have been left open to catch the breezes of the night.</description>
    <description>Just out of reach above the balcony, an amazing and intricate set of mirrors hangs beneath the skylights at the top of the great shaft.  No matter where the sun travels in the sky, the mirrors catch the rays of light, and redirect them down into the lightwell.  At the same time, the heated mirrors draw air up the shaft to be released out the skylights with cleverly arranged openings.</description>

A collection of wooden card tables and flimsy chairs are scattered about the cramped space, hastily pushed together or shoved aside as the gamblers change games and fortunes with each card drawn.  An occasional curse rings through the air to drown out the whirr of cards and the clink of coins changing hands.</description>

Carefully tended and cultivated greenery has been laid out on either side of the road, sustaining a wealth of life in spite of the harsh climate.  Flanked by guardsmen in gleaming armor, a broad gate pierces the wall around the palace grounds, leading back to the city proper.</description>

    <description>Passing between low, thick greenery and beds ablaze with colorful flowers, the crushed coral road follows a great curve between the gate and the palace, both visible in the distance.  Delicate scents drift across the quiet way from the purple, red and white blooms amid the plantings.  A grove of trees planted before the grand palace offers a shady counterpoint to the harsh desert air that slips in over the walls of the palace grounds.</description>

    <description>Broadening into a small lot as it reaches the palace, the crushed coral road curves away from the doors in two directions.  The tall entry facade belonging to Shorka's Palace stretches between a pair of slender, carved stone minarets faced with spiraling bands of polychrome tile.  Tall double doors lead into the great building, set back within a niche in the grand facade.  Opposite the doors is a grove of trees placed to cast shade over the road.</description>

    <description>About halfway up one of the massive arms of a huge, star-shaped dune, the landscape of the desert becomes slightly more apparent.  Stretching out in all directions further than the eye can see, great sandy mountains are the only decoration on an endless canvas of blowing amber grains, shifting about on a generational timescale.  Many of the peaks rise not much higher than this vantage point, though several lift daringly into the sky, as if challenging the desert wind to obliterate them.</description>
    <description>This low valley surrounded on all sides by immense, star-shaped dunes is just one of many locations within the expansive Velaka Desert that a hapless wanderer could be forgotten for eternity.  No sign of the horizon can be found from the bottom of this basin, edged in on all sides by almost insurmountable walls of loose sand, shifting in the slightest breeze yet refusing to give way.  The broad swath of sky overhead only reinforces the image of a hopelessly deep trough in an ocean of sand.</description>
    <description>Nearing the midsection of this massive arm which radiates outward from the center of an enormous star-shaped dune, the Velaka Desert stands solemnly desolate under the cover of night.  Though the sandy mountain is one in a sea of similar shapes stretching as far as the eye can see, cast in the shadow of darkness it manages to retain a solitary appearance.  Still, several peaks rise yet higher into the air, as if challenging the wind to obliterate them before morning.</description>
    <description>Dark and oppressive shapes loom on all sides, the shadowy nocturnal visages of the towering star-shaped dunes which dominate this portion of the Velaka Desert, stoic and silent.  The horizon in every direction is blocked by the hulking mountains of sand, making navigation by landmark an impossibility, the dunes themselves changing shape in the passing wind.  Overhead, visible only over the peaks of the darkened hills, the sky serves as a reminder of the depth of the valley.</description>
    <description>The entirety of Velaka spreads out below this colossus of sand, the tremendous height of the mountain towering over all others within sight.  From here the famous star-shaped patterns of the dune field are immediately apparent, looking much like an army of immense starfish crawling toward the mountains on the horizon out of a great ocean, leagues away.  Unlike many of the other regions of the desert, no telltale signs of life persist here, proving this as the most untouched corner of this barren land.</description>

The sands of the pit have a dry, loose texture and they swirl about like the rapids of a river, consuming those foolish enough to tread within them.  More than merely eating away at the skin, though, the sands create the sensation that there's something more alive burrowing within the body.  A thick vine crawls along the side of the pit, leading back to the surface.</description>

The narrow hall affords little more space than is needed to walk through into the deeper sections of the temple, with rows of benches on either wall only further discouraging loiterers.  What the room lacks in width is made up for by its height the smooth walls gradually come together high above at an acute angle, the uppermost point shrouded in shadow.</description>

Ghostly tallow candles -- the only permanent light source for the small room -- burn atop their respective perches, working desperately to illumine the paintings that line the curving walls.</description>

Several potted plants and shelves line the room's perimeter, the tall ceilings and rounded chimneys overhead providing adequate ventilation for any experiments with unexpected results.</description>

    <description>Silken rigging suspends the sweeping teak sloop's deck from the semi-rigid envelope above.  Shaded silk-cushioned benches along the bow's rail offer comfort and a spectacular view from the ship.  A cylindrical copper device, about the size of a large bread oven, snakes a half dozen tubes upward into the bottom of the segmented balloon.  Aft of the device, the quarterdeck rises to elevate the ship's wheel, while beyond, a cherrywood door marks the entrance to a small cabin.  To the left of the door hangs a framed painting, and to the right is a small porthole.</description>

Two thickly-padded armchairs angle towards an ornately carved writing desk along a far wall, providing a place for the Society Master to meet with various members and see to official paperwork.  The heavy scent of sandalwood drifts from an incense burner on a nearby cart.</description>

    <description>S'Kra Mur clerks toil away inside a cramped room, made to seem far smaller thanks to mounted wall racks loaded with yellowed vellum scrolls, stacks of parchment sheaves piled in the corners, and decoratively carved oak desks -- ornamentation strikingly unusual in bureaucratic offices.  A door, sealed by an iron bar, leads deeper into the building, perhaps for additional paper storage.  On the opposite side of the room, an archway leads back to the streets outside.</description>
