    <description>Gauzy blue sunshades far above reach out from building eaves on either side of the way, shifting in slight desert breezes and shading the daytime strollers below.  An inn to one side has seen better days, but still seems to do a brisk business with all the traffic.  The constant crowd of the street makes it difficult going for merchant caravans on their way to the Great Gate to the southeast.</description>
    <description>The sound of fabric flapping in the night breezes comes down to the street from somewhere overhead, beyond the range of sight.  An inn to one side has seen better days, but still looks well off with what customers it manages to attract.  The crowds of the day have dissipated, leaving only the occasional patron stepping into the inn for the night.</description>

    <description>Whitewashed walls seem to pull the light down into the street, throwing small but sharp shadows away from people and objects.  Ignoring the traffic of everyday life passing upon the way, a cat naps upon the front step of a building.  A wall topped with slate blue tiles separates the Carousel Square from the staho, but no gate blocks the wide archway leading through the wall to the square.</description>

Here the soft stone shows its age, with hairline cracks running across the occasional wall or storefront, some extending from the ground below to the crest of the structure several stories overhead.</description>
    <description>Deep darkness engulfs the southern sector of this pathway, shadows from the tall (and often mismatched) buildings made unforgiving by the cloak of night.  All is silent, a rare lack of sound in the normally bustling city, as the structures that normally provide forgiving shade now swallow both sound and light.</description>

A rhythmic beat that pulses with the heart keeps a constant undertone to travelers' shifting feet.</description>

Having paid homage to the noble S'Kra depicted, they continue on their way, returning their attentions to the crowds that gather to watch the never-ending sideshows.  A display of paintings are sheltered under the awning of a nearby building.  The budding artist hovers protectively in front of the oils as he hawks his greatest works.</description>

The featureless stones leave no cover for any intruder that might have breached the gate of the old fort, giving the arrow slits high up on the walls an ominous character.

    <description>A wide bay window set into the far wall looks out over the sleeping city, beneath it resting a window seat covered in pale pink velvet on which to relax and gaze at the sparkling stars.  A white four-poster bed draped with a delicate rose coverlet lies in one corner of the room, opposite a matching vanity set with an oval mirror where guests may check their appearance before descending to the tavern.</description>

    <description>Thick, choking clouds of smoke swirl about your head from the smelly cigars favored by the regular occupants of this tiny gaming room.  A collection of wooden card tables and flimsy chairs are scattered about the cramped space, hastily pushed together or shoved aside as the gamblers change games and fortunes with each card drawn.  An occasional curse rings through the air to drown out the whirr of cards and the clink of coins changing hands.</description>

    <description>Broken colored tiles arranged in a circular pattern brighten the sides of the plaza set between the walls of the Traders' Guild.  Sturdy masoned tables are scattered about the area, in hopes of attracting the odd customer that wanders in from the dusty streets.  Stone dragons expertly carved crest the tall wide arch leading out to the street, their wings and tails stretching to meet the limestone walls of the guild.  On the opposite side stand the double deobar doors that lead into the main hall.</description>

The air is frigid with chill, warm lanterns offering little reprieve from the merciless desert night.

    <description>Passing between low, thick greenery and beds ablaze with colorful flowers, the crushed coral road follows a great curve between the gate and the palace, both visible in the distance.  Delicate scents drift across the quiet way from the purple, red and white blooms amid the plantings.  A grove of trees planted before the grand palace offers a shady counterpoint to the harsh desert air that slips in over the walls of the palace grounds.</description>

    <description>Broadening into a small lot as it reaches the palace, the crushed coral road curves away from the doors in two directions.  The tall entry facade belonging to Shorka's Palace stretches between a pair of slender, carved stone minarets faced with spiraling bands of polychrome tile.  Tall double doors lead into the great building, set back within a niche in the grand facade.  Opposite the doors is a grove of trees placed to cast shade over the road.</description>

    <description>About halfway up one of the massive arms of a huge, star-shaped dune, the landscape of the desert becomes slightly more apparent.  Stretching out in all directions further than the eye can see, great sandy mountains are the only decoration on an endless canvas of blowing amber grains, shifting about on a generational timescale.  Many of the peaks rise not much higher than this vantage point, though several lift daringly into the sky, as if challenging the desert wind to obliterate them.</description>
    <description>This low valley surrounded on all sides by immense, star-shaped dunes is just one of many locations within the expansive Velaka Desert that a hapless wanderer could be forgotten for eternity.  No sign of the horizon can be found from the bottom of this basin, edged in on all sides by almost insurmountable walls of loose sand, shifting in the slightest breeze yet refusing to give way.  The broad swath of sky overhead only reinforces the image of a hopelessly deep trough in an ocean of sand.</description>
    <description>Nearing the midsection of this massive arm which radiates outward from the center of an enormous star-shaped dune, the Velaka Desert stands solemnly desolate under the cover of night.  Though the sandy mountain is one in a sea of similar shapes stretching as far as the eye can see, cast in the shadow of darkness it manages to retain a solitary appearance.  Still, several peaks rise yet higher into the air, as if challenging the wind to obliterate them before morning.</description>
    <description>Dark and oppressive shapes loom on all sides, the shadowy nocturnal visages of the towering star-shaped dunes which dominate this portion of the Velaka Desert, stoic and silent.  The horizon in every direction is blocked by the hulking mountains of sand, making navigation by landmark an impossibility, the dunes themselves changing shape in the passing wind.  Overhead, visible only over the peaks of the darkened hills, the sky serves as a reminder of the depth of the valley.</description>
    <description>The entirety of Velaka spreads out below this colossus of sand, the tremendous height of the mountain towering over all others within sight.  From here the famous star-shaped patterns of the dune field are immediately apparent, looking much like an army of immense starfish crawling toward the mountains on the horizon out of a great ocean, leagues away.  Unlike many of the other regions of the desert, no telltale signs of life persist here, proving this as the most untouched corner of this barren land.</description>

    <description>As it follows the curve of the palace wall, the lightly packed sand of the path suggests its purpose as a scenic byway.  Unlike the more heavily traveled trade roads that cross the desert, this trail allows for a leisurely pace while partially sheltered from the sand-laden winds by the wall of Shorka's Palace itself.</description>

Ignoring the wonder of life's indomitable nature around them, destitute laborers carrying heavy packs of salt occasionally ascend the path, starting their long trudge back to the city gate.</description>
    <description>The hardy scrub pines that have managed to survive and spread on this rocky slope are nearly invisible by night, but their dark shapes soften the hard edges of the sharp rocks and the unmistakable scent of pine fills the air.  The area has proven attractive to the local wildlife as well -- rustling noises can be heard as small animals move about, and intermittent calls of night birds also break the silence.</description>

Low walls of clay-rich soil divide the irregularly shaped pools of water, fed by a system of tiny canals and moveable wooden chutes that carry salt water from the nearby Lake Ratamipak.  The ponds around the end of the road here are furthest from the lake, giving them the least access to water and going through fewer production cycles, making them marginal investments.</description>

    <description>All around you is nothing but sand surrounded by high, craggy walls, with no obvious way out.  The walls are too steep to climb, and even if the protrusions didn't appear so lethal, it seems many would crumble under pressure.</description>

    <description>There's a marked difference between the normal sands outside this pit and the sands within.  The sands of the pit have a dry, loose texture and they swirl about like the rapids of a river, consuming those foolish enough to tread within them.  More than merely eating away at the skin, though, the sands create the sensation that there's something more alive burrowing within the body.</description>

The narrow hall affords little more space than is needed to walk through into the deeper sections of the temple, with rows of benches on either wall only further discouraging loiterers.  What the room lacks in width is made up for by its height the smooth walls gradually come together high above at an acute angle, the uppermost point shrouded in shadow.</description>

A fine crack runs diagonally through the glossy stone, splitting it neatly in half, though the two segments remain pressed together.  Ghostly tallow candles -- the only permanent light source for the small room -- burn atop their respective perches, working desperately to illumine the paintings that line the curving walls.</description>

    <description>A musty odor of still air and dust envelops the room, made all the more poignant by the quiet of the desert night.

Aft of the device, the quarterdeck rises to elevate the ship's wheel, while beyond, a cherrywood door marks the entrance to a small cabin.  To the left of the door hangs a framed painting, and to the right is a small porthole.</description>

A door, sealed by an iron bar, leads deeper into the building, perhaps for additional paper storage.  On the opposite side of the room, an archway leads back to the streets outside.</description>
