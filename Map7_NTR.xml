    <description>Dirt meets stone here as a road begins its winding journey north along a cut-out hillside shrouded by a grove of trees. Just a few hundred feet north a large growth of reeds forces a jog to the northwest.  In a clump of weeds sits a makeshift stone bench and small pile of stones.  If it was once a shrine, someone has long since removed the statue and abandoned its care.</description>

    <description>Tapping your foot on the ground, the hardness of stone confirms you are on the road.  You feel your way about searching for the hillside to the west or the reeds to the east.  Once oriented, a sense of calm returns and you consider your options.</description>
    <description>The stones of the road fit seamlessly together, locked to each other without mortar.  Traces of rust form two paths in this curve where the iron rims of the wagon wheels have paid the price of taking the turn too fast.  A bullfrog croaks out his presence somewhere in the tall reeds that line the road.  The shade of the trees to the northwest is alluring yet daunting.</description>

    <description>Gnats swarm annoyingly about your head, prompting you to bat at them with your hand in vain.  To the north, you can see where the road leaves the shadows and enters the safety of daylight about a half a mile away.  Curving to the southeast, the road leads you to the closest exit for this grove.  Moss clings to the stones of the road where it meets the water and reeds to the east.</description>

    <description>Some reeds have been hacked away close to the road, undoubtedly destined to become someone's new basket.  The removal has left an opening in the reeds allowing you to peer into the marsh on the other side which seemingly waits for its next victim.  A water beetle that is traveling through the mud stops and waves its feelers at you in what seems to be a challenge before continuing on its way.</description>

    <description>The lack of direct sunlight here is daunting.  You can't seem to suppress the notion this is the perfect place for highway bandits to ply their trade.  Squinting at the deeper shadows, you search the area for possible ambush locations and poke at the reeds just to make sure.  A quick glance north and south confirms you are in the middle of the grove.</description>

    <description>High reeds create a thick wall to the southeast. A makeshift target is tacked to the closest tree.  Someone has been practicing their archery, and on closer inspection you see the arrowheads that are now and forever a part of the tree. To the northwest you see a large bridge now in ruin, which used to span the river.  To the south the road heads directly into the shadows of a grove of trees.</description>

    <description>A large stone bridge that once spanned the expanse of the river here, now lays in ruin.  The town of Riverhaven, the bridge's orginal destination, sits on the other side.  Gazing at the town, the orange glow of the town's street torches forms an eerie dome in the night sky.  To the southeast, a wall of reeds creeps down from a group of trees into the river and attempts to survive the currents of the river.</description>

    <description>Smoke fills the air, not enough to stifle one's breath but enough to cast ominous shadows.  Tables, usually filled with hungry patrons, lay in smoldering pieces.  The hearth's mantel is burned through its middle as if the flame had escaped its brick confines.  The walls are discolored by scorching save for a spot along one wall where the wood grain still shows through.  The damage done to the room seems to have removed all of Penelope Burrows' touches that made this a cheerful place to eat.</description>

A cushioned bench lies snapped in two after taking the brunt of the fallen ceiling rafter, while several others lay scattered about by the impact.  Glass cases, formerly attached to the wooden walls, rest in shattered heaps.</description>

Except for a few jars broken on the ground, the remaining jars of herbal remedies and boxes of bandages are still somewhat in order on narrow wooden shelves.  Lard candles and sprigs of dried coneflowers remain hanging from a peg rail.  Fresh globs of wax upon the floor prove someone was here recently and perhaps even took shelter in this room.</description>

Decorative blue glazed globes lay in shattered heaps, their contents of willows branches and daylilies trampled and wilted.  A potbelly stove lies prone with large rents in its sides as though something held inside had forceably escaped.

    <description>The outdoor section of the stables is nothing more than a level patch of bare ground roughly fenced off with stonework augmented with a few warped and burned wooden planks.  Several dispirited horses wander about cropping at the few tufts of grass that can find root.  A feed trough holds the remnants of some hay as well and there is a good supply of water.  A wooden gate leads into the stable itself.</description>

    <description>Jagged shards of obsidian thrust up from the parched earth at odd angles, formed by the shifting lava flows.  Faint hints of olivine streak the glassy surface.  The sharp edges and poisonous green color give rise to the local name for this area, the Fangs of Ushnish.  As lava cools, it hardens, only to break out again in another location.  The path through the field is never constant as nature's wrath, or that of the god, makes itself known in molten rock.</description>

    <description>A sprawling ranch-style house sits nestled beneath the boughs of a grove of tall old oaks.  The smell of fresh baking wafts invitingly from its open door. Beside the house lies a small, carefully tended garden, with vegetables and herbs lined up in neat rows around an old stone well.  The sound of whinnying horses rings out from the broad doors of a red painted barn to the east.</description>

Swarms of flies close about you, and some land to drill into your flesh for a morsel of blood and to leave a stinging welt as a souvenir of your visit to their lands.  Northwards, the ground rises from the bog into open lands, while southward a mist obscures the view.</description>

Perhaps some vanished town lay near here that knew the value of good roads.</description>

Small animals skitter among the branches overhead and dart among low-growing shrubs that eke out an existence in the deep shade of the forest.

Peering into the deep hole, you find that it's filled with water, the surface about thirty feet below you.  Judging from the smoothness of the walls and a skeleton still clinging to the rocks below, you surmise that jumping into this cenote might be a bad idea.</description>

    <description>A massive rockslide has cut off any further western passage along the Journalai Route by caravan, and the slide itself looks too unstable and massive to climb safely.  You can catch a glimpse of sweeping forested mountainside just beyond the barrier, the caps of the peaks frosted with eternal snows.</description>

    <description>High Street continues its gentle progress to the east, its smooth sandstone paving diligently swept free of any dust and debris which might settle for half a moment.  The homes which claim this part of town are slightly larger than the average Lower Kaerna cottage, and each owner clearly takes great pride in preserving the superiority of the neighborhood.</description>

    <description>The door to the volcanic fortress is comprised of two enormous obsidian panels, both ornately carved.  The slender path, chiseled from the lava, leads to a large stone staircase descending to the ground below.  Embedded in the dense rock above the entrance rests a crystal hand encircled by angular runes.</description>
    <description>Shadows of night embrace the stalwart doors leading into the fortress.  The dark obsidian panels glisten with the light of the crystal hand set into the volcanic rock above them, their spiraling patterns and angular runes shimmering in the sparse illumination.  A spartan staircase travels down the face of the stone walls.</description>
    <description>The once mighty obsidian doors are fallen, shattered, and the way clogged with ruin.  All that remains of its former occupants are bits of bone and the remnants of a large crystal hand, scattered when it was dashed to the ground.  A spartan staircase, chiseled from lava, winds down the face of the stony wall.</description>

    <description>This room is breathtakingly massive in size.  The walls shimmer like sheer glass, and the floor itself is made of a black, bubbled obsidian.  Cut into the low ceiling is a narrow opening that leads up to an abandoned mine shaft.  Faint light trickles through it, the only illumination and the one thing that still connects the cavern to the world that waits outside it.</description>

Shoved face-first into the obsidian walls, it is hard to tell what this hapless man's last expression was, but a guess would estimate that it was not a happy one.  Fickle light from the west plays off the pristine white of his clothing, preserved forever within the opaque surface.</description>

    <description>The steady drip of water trickling down the sides of the smooth obsidian walls reverberates with a cascade of echoes throughout the dark shaft.  Creaking loudly with any weight placed upon its shabby rungs, the old ladder adds readily to the strange music.

Looking as though it might fall from the rotted wood at any moment, an old oil lamp hanging from one of the few remaining rungs of the ladder proves that others have also attempted this climb up the shaft.  The obvious lack of any further handholds, either man-made or natural, makes it clear that retreat is now the only possible means of escape.</description>

Future master smiths plot their technique choices as they study charts detailing their future career options.  All the while, master smiths deliberate over the design of their soon to be made new master crafter's mark.</description>
