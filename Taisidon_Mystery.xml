    <description>A small grove of trees grows alongside the lagoon, their broad sweeping branches reaching low and laden with the deep purple phofe flowers.  These perfumed blossoms are so rare that they can only be found in this one location.  The dampness that hovers over this island clings to the petals, filling the air with an intoxicating haze.</description>

    <description>Freed from the protective circle of the lagoon, the surface of the sea is deceptively tranquil.  A fallen palm tree lies in the surf, battered by the incessant lapping of the waves, while nearby, where the jungle creeps up to the beach, a small pile of oyster shells draws flies under a durian tree.</description>

    <description>Tropical brush and vines creep over the rocky divide between beach and jungle, seeking light and room to put down roots.  As the beach curves towards some rocky cliffs to the north, the sea works at eroding the narrowing expanse, stealing a bit of sand with each gentle wave.</description>

    <description>Rock formations rising out of the sand make the path from the lagoon to the cliffs circuitous.  Two large stones lean against each other in mute harmony, framing the sea in a natural arch.  At the edge of the jungle, spiny fruits litter the ground under durian trees, swelling and cracking in the heat, sending a cloying rot to mix with the scent of the sea.</description>

    <description>Waves surge forcefully across the narrowing beach crashing against the foot of the volcanic rock cliffs rising overhead before being sucked back into the sea.  The jungle edges forward in what little sand remains, exposed roots recoiling from the salty water while quickly tacking in place any soil blown by the wind.  A felled durian tree, serving as a home for a few industrious sand crabs, lies across the path to a rocky point that extends into the churning surf.</description>

    <description>The rocky point serves to break the force of the waves and halt complete erosion of the beach to the south.  Angry water churns and thrashes against the craggy foundation of this stolid bastion, intermittently filling the air with salty spray.  A semi-circular ring of cliffs to the north and volcanic rock formations rising from the bottom of the sea provide a turbulent residence for beds of oysters, as well as a challenging dive into the surf for those in search of pearls.</description>
