To the north are the majestic Himineldar -- rocky giants laced with ribbons of green trees that grow sparse and then fade away at the uppermost reaches.  A dense mist hangs around the heights, giving the mountains a hazy, dreamlike aura from this distance.  Among the wind-gnarled pines of the foothills, the road continues along its winding path.</description>

Shattered blocks of rock scattered among the overgrown brush hint that this area may once have been a quarry, though the lush growth of lupine among the fragments show that it is long abandoned.  To the east, thin young saplings mark the beginning of a spanning forest, while to the west, rocky grasslands roll down into a basin nestled in the shadows of the Himineldar.</description>

River stones have been piled up above the hot coals, and a planked pine framework placed over them with a second fire burning on top -- the whole creating an inferno from which the distinctive Horse Clan pottery is born.  Nearby, large baskets of cedar kindling and dried horse manure stand ready to replenish the hungry flames.</description>

    <description>As the open roadway clings to the massive flank of the mountain, the forest seems to glower angrily, its branches clawing for complete dominion of the valley.  Only the crushing passage of enormous beasts has kept the mikkhalbamar at bay.  A tangled deadfall stretches deep into the trees while a massive crag to the south opens into a narrow canyon walled by sheer cliffs.</description>

Silent evidence of battle litters the ground riven siege towers, wrecked onagers and shattered scorpions have been trodden nearly to splinters by time and the footfalls of great beasts.</description>

    <description>The peak of Wyvern Mountain rises to pierce the night sky, offering a clear view of both the heavens and the darkened land.  The lights of Raven's Point shine in the mountains of Forfedhdar, while the southern lands lie dark under the cloak of night.  Shard's glow plays off the the many converging rivers to the east, while past the dark fingers of the Dragonspine mountains, the city of Crossing illuminates the horizon.  Darkness settles over the land, quieting the view from the lonely mountain peak.</description>

Splintered shards of ice lie haphazardly about, crystalline missiles dropped from the overhanging cliffs when their weight becomes too much to bear.  Fine, powdery snow piles in sparkling drifts that hug the mountain's cliffs, filling in the shatter lines that spiderweb through the ice sheet's surface.</description>

Gritty snow crusted over with frozen melt forms a thick layer over the granite rock below, making the few bare spots seem dark by comparison.  Shifting ice from the massive glacier occasionally gives off a sharp crack that pierces the air, breaking the lonely silence of the frozen mountaintop.</description>

    <description>Seeping from the ground, a tiny spring burbles within the forest, its waters making the area more humid while providing a source of moisture for delicate plants.  One bank of the pool shows signs that the waters are also used by the forest's denizens as welcome refreshment.</description>

    <description>The game trails that wend their way through the heavy undergrowth come together long enough to split apart again.  The rustle of leaves gives evidence of something lurking just beyond sight, but nothing gives any clue as to the unknown creature's identity.</description>

    <description>Falling like a curtain from the canopy, a wall of vines has interwoven itself so tightly that it blocks further passage in some directions.  Game trails twist their way through the rest of the trees, joining and parting like a meandering stream.</description>

    <description>Broad branches provide a safe place to escape the crowded forest floor with its dangerous creatures and cloying vegetation.  Unfortunately, further progress up the tree is blocked by a heavy growth of vines and creepers that has so intermingled that it is like a living wall.</description>

    <description>The trail takes a sharp turn at a rocky outcrop that emerges from the surrounding forest, its sides too steep and rocky to allow much vegetation to grow.
