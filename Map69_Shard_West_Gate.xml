To the north are the majestic Himineldar -- rocky giants laced with ribbons of green trees that grow sparse and then fade away at the uppermost reaches.  A dense mist hangs around the heights, giving the mountains a hazy, dreamlike aura from this distance.  Among the wind-gnarled pines of the foothills, the road continues along its winding path.</description>

Silent evidence of battle litters the ground riven siege towers, wrecked onagers and shattered scorpions have been trodden nearly to splinters by time and the footfalls of great beasts.</description>

    <description>The snow at the top of this treacherous cliff is crusty and unstable, frequently giving way and making passage incredibly difficult.  Splintered shards of ice lie haphazardly about, crystalline missiles dropped from the overhanging cliffs when their weight becomes too much to bear.  Fine, powdery snow piles in sparkling drifts that hug the mountain's cliffs, filling in the shatter lines that spiderweb through the ice sheet's surface.</description>

    <description>A pile of boulders rests uneasily at the top of the mountain's cap, feathered in elaborate ice crystal patterns growing over their surfaces.  Gritty snow crusted over with frozen melt forms a thick layer over the granite rock below, making the few bare spots seem dark by comparison.  Shifting ice from the massive glacier occasionally gives off a sharp crack that pierces the air, breaking the lonely silence of the frozen mountaintop.</description>

    <description>Six evenly placed skylights, each covered with clear quartz, are cut into the rough stone of this cavern's ceiling, their angled design funneling sunlight down upon carefully tended flora.  Unexpectedly lush, the decorative grasses and hostas are nevertheless overshadowed by a wide variety of irises in a dizzying array of colors.  Even more remarkable, many of the flowers bear blooms of quite unusual size, some nearly dwarfing a dinner plate.</description>

    <description>Broad branches provide a safe place to escape the crowded forest floor with its dangerous creatures and cloying vegetation.  Unfortunately, further progress up the tree is blocked by a heavy growth of vines and creepers that has so intermingled that it is like a living wall.</description>

    <description>Underbrush crowds up against the taller trees, almost choking out any passage.  Forest creatures, however, have left their mark and a few twisting passages allow for travel deeper within the wilderness.</description>

    <description>The stench of something rotting suffuses the air, cloying and fetid at the same time.  Along with the onmipresent fetor, the trail is swarming with flies and other hovering insects, drawn to the odor like hummingbirds to flowers.</description>

    <description>The trail takes a sharp turn at a rocky outcrop that emerges from the surrounding forest, its sides too steep and rocky to allow much vegetation to grow.  A few creepers, however, have managed to secure a foothold and have begun their work of insinuating roots into the slabs.</description>

    <description>Sheer cliffs rise out of the trees, blocking further passage even more emphatically than the constricting vegetation.  Even the most vigorous vines have been unable to secure purchase in the hard rocks, which offer no openings for foot or root.</description>

    <description>Ropes and cables drape and hang from the ceilings and snake across the area to sturdy bolts sunk into the masonry walls.  Thick mats cover the floor, cushioning any falls from the adventurous users of the training equipment. Subdued lighting comes from the gaethzen spheres scattered about the space.</description>

    <description>Jutting out from the walls are a number of metal bars running parallel to the walls, each set at a different height.  The varied elevations allow for easy training by those of differing statures.  A bowl of powdered chalk stands off to one side, providing an aid for sweaty grips.</description>
