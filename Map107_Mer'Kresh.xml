    <description>A barrier of hostas and ferns set between the flagstones and a fountain is wide enough to block visitors tempted to leave the path but narrow enough that with a favorable breeze someone could toss a few crackers into the water.  Speckled carp swim lazily in the fountain, some weave among the lily pad stems and some nudge against the curved bowl as if looking for a crumb of bread.  A thicket of forsythia grows between the path and the carillon.</description>

    <description>Curving from the south, the flagstone path continues its tour around the Carillon, still visible as it rises above the trees lining the inner side of the path.  A small herd of metal oxen grazes among stands of ornamental grass.  Garlands, each woven of vines, bits of paper, and flowers have been placed around the necks of the sculpture.</description>

    <description>Soft cooing floats from a dovecote sitting on the outer side of the path, and periodically a curious bird pokes its head out to gaze at the passersby.  Light glints off the breeze-rippled surface of a shallow reflecting pool.  At the end across from the dovecote is a bronze statue of a woman kneeling as she sets a toy ship into the pool.  The carillon is visible to the southwest.</description>

    <description>Several black basalt slabs surrounding a sphere sculpted from lava sit near the inner edge of the path.  A flame flickers from atop the ball, an eternal reminder of the fire warming the heart of M'Riss.  A curved bench rests on the outer edge of the flagstones, providing a clear view of the carillon rising in the distance behind the garden's stone sentinels.</description>

Untrellised, straggling wysteria dot the area between the path and the carillon, their slender switches lashing in even the slightest breeze as though a gale were blowing through them.</description>

    <description>Bamboo chimes dangle from the branches of a grove of rosewood trees that separates the path from the carillon.  Lilies ring the trunks of the rosewoods and between them, a vibrant carpet of crocus paints a sea of color.  On the opposite side of the path, a bed of tiny, multi-hued shells holds a large bronze chime and a statue of a sitting jackal.  Dull basalt stepping stones skirt the shells and disappear into a stand of mimosa.</description>

Roses mingling with honeysuckle climb the bridge's posts and stretch across its handrails.  Tangled vines grow along the banks of the stream and knee-high shrub parterres filled with flowers border the path.  As the path curves, the carillon can be seen rising to the north east.</description>

    <description>Towering above the city, the Carillon tolls the sailor's watch and serves as a look-out for those who wait for a mariner's return.  Centered on the innermost disk, this slender obelisk is home to those who seek comfort and counsel.  Flecks of quartz in the sandy granite exterior sparkle in the light, and stained glass windows, like a jeweled belt, encircle the building midway to the top.  Atop, bells hang in the open arches supporting the roof.</description>

    <description>Unlike the other bridges, Dajere Bridge is unique in the way it crosses the canals.  Except for where it connects with both Gull Circle and Shell Circle, the bridge is free-standing, supported only by scalloped basalt columns rising from the canals.  Enough space is left between the pilings to allow barges and gondolas free passage beneath the bridge, as well as plenty of room for the daring seagull or pelican to swoop after a meal.</description>

Nestled in the seedier section of town, the wharf warehouses are filled with goods from smaller docks along the canal, which in turn are fed by the barges that cautiously manuever across the water.  If one were to stay here for several hours, the entire process of loading and unloading could be easily seen from this section of the bridge.</description>

A circle of gull feathers surrounds the refuse-filled pit, left behind when their previous owners swooped in for a quick meal.  Along one side, a wooden plank has been fastened down to keep the hole from swallowing runaway wheelbarrows.</description>

    <description>A dented wheelbarrow lies beneath the unfinished lip of Zirelga Bridge, its handles cracked and its contents long gone.  At this stage of construction, the bridge is little more than a glorified dumping ramp, used by workers to unload their hauls of garbage.  A stone block, halfway up the support of the bridge, channels the dumped rubbish to one side.  From there, the debris is carried off to fill in holes along the road.</description>

    <description>The swirling and foaming waters of the ocean churn against the black basalt exposed from beneath the road as a sudden transition takes place.  The rock and wooden framework of a construction in progress yields to the intermittent placement of dark stones rising from the sea.  The rectangular walls are representatives of the first stages of ring-building, and are designed to be platforms to support both workers and the later layers of stones.</description>

    <description>Here, the road is nothing more than the top of several closely packed stone walls.  Shiny from the sea waters washing over them, the largest of the walls flank either side of where the finished road will be, and the spaces between will eventually be filled with rubble, rock and garbage.  The western most wall is severed from this section of the road by a water-filled channel, so any travel to the north must take place across the surface of the eastern one.</description>

The dark pool of water gurgles with every thrust of the waves, but the walls of its confinement keep it mainly separate from the freedom of the wide ocean.  One large stone, reinforced with wooden supports, sits directly across from the bulge on the other side of the channel that guts the middle of the road.</description>

    <description>Jagged basalt clamors in the surf around the bases of the stone walls, wet and sharp.  Northwards, room to walk is virtually non-existent, replaced by the chaotic piles of the black stones.  Above the rocky clutter, a wooden walkway allows workers to continue with their tasks in relative safety.  Here and south, only the flat tops of the water barrier is available to stand upon.</description>

Hanging from one of the support beams, a bucket sways in the wind, its contents clattering as it moves.  Just beneath the planking of the makeshift walkway, the explosive sound of the ocean washing over the jumbled stones shakes the wood, and sends the bucket into yet another shifting motion.</description>

The boards, glossy and green from the constant dampness, shudder under the slightest weight or the most gentle push of the wind.  Whenever a particularly potent wave slams into the barrier, some unseen part of the walkway growls angrily as it shakes and repositions itself.</description>

One heavy black stone in particular is a favorite spot for the waves to dash, if only because its great size presents such a good target.  Just poking from the surface of the waves, another series of black basalt curves in mimicry, shielding this one from the worst of the ocean's assault.</description>

All manner of rough stonework is half-buried in the mounds, from cracked sculptures and friezes to the remnants of support columns and paving stones.  Some are glaringly apparent, the white of pitted marble contrasting sharply with the dark basalt.  Others are more subtle, like the mostly-covered face of the statue gazing from the shattered rocks.</description>

    <description>The backsides of warehouses butt against the street as it curves towards the north and south.  Many days have come and gone since they were constructed, but their cracking bodies still can safely hold a horde of supplies from prying eyes.  Slogans and ads cover the streetside buildings from the ground to an arm's length above the height of the average Elf.  Few areas are spared, and both homes and commercial buildings wear the plastered advertisements.</description>

The building is as old and grey as the rest of the structures around this part of Mer'Kresh, but is hardly in disrepair.  Something unseen speaks of charming grandeur, like a whisper just out of earshot drifting on a breeze.  A small stone fountain trickles contentedly in the yard, adding another touch of elegance to the scene.</description>

    <description>An odd little building of cypress on a stone foundation stands north of the road.  From its windows, small and low to the ground, come laughter, song, and a warm, soft light.  Of all its oddities, the most striking is its entryway, through yawning, bleached jaws that once armed an enormous shark.  The gaping maw is hung with a net curtain, and over this fierce yet intriguing entrance hangs a sign.</description>

Somewhere fairly close, the sounds of sloshing water sneaks out to the street, barely perceptible when the wind jostles through the canyon of structures along the street.  Squares of colored paper flicker with the breeze, half-covering a faded diorama along the face of one of the larger buildings.</description>

The cry of gulls that is so common during the daylight hours is missing, and a few white feathers drifting casually on the street become a reminder of their visits.</description>
    <description>Several seagulls strut and flit along the ground, snatching scraps of garbage and discarded food before hopping off to devour their meals.  The gulls are considerably braver here than elsewhere in Mer'Kresh, though this may owe as much to the abundance of loose trash as it does to any courage the birds can muster.

A stack of leftover bricks sits to one side of the main causeway, no longer needed now that this section of Gull Circle is nearing completion.</description>

    <description>The most prominent feature of the end of the road is the massive bronze-wrapped tower that will, once finished, hold the northern half of the canal gate in place.  Practically a work of art, the tower stretches high overhead, holding several colorful banners aloft.  Taut ropes run from the midsection, the top, and a point inbetween, down to several metal loops along the ground.  A pile of jagged rocks, discarded from the construction of the road, lean against the ring from inside the canal.</description>

Jewel-eyed bronze dolphins leap among sprays of water surging from the fountain in front of the theater.

    <description>Two ship's masts stretch between the hospital and the crescent-shaped Empath's hall, lodged firmly in the walls of each.  A sturdy walkway connects the two buildings with the mast's firm support as the pink walls of the hospital stare beneath at the slope dropping away from the Empath's hall.  Those areas of the horizon that aren't blocked by the dual structures exposes Mer'Kresh in all its splendor as well as the far shores of M'Riss.</description>

The far side of the walkway collides into one wall of a pale crescent-shaped building.  A simple wooden plaque gazes across as a few dried rose petals swirl in the air beneath it.</description>

Mer'Kresh is not difficult to see, as this lofty vantage turns the streets and roads into ripples on the surface of a puddle, radiating outwards from the Carillion at the center of town.</description>

    <description>The stone wall separating this room from the common room keeps the noise down to a dull roar, making it a preferred location for intimate or discrete conversation over dinner.  The oak benches here are smoother than their counterparts in the common room, and the trestle table has a tablecloth.  Even so, the real attraction is being at Saja's but out of the common room.</description>

    <description>This battered oak booth is a favorite haunt of bards and students and home to near continuous discussion.  The topics tend toward wine, women and song, but even when they're intellectual, they're never less than heated.  Be it coffee by day or ale by night, the semi-permanent residents of this booth drink too much.  The trestle tables and oaken benches are battered beyond belief, but the history is such Saja would never dare replace them.</description>

The grass has been trimmed closely along the sides of a gravel path and bands of flowering plants curve alongside all the way to the walls of a sturdy stone building across from an iron gate.</description>
    <description>A dark mass of plants clings tenaciously to the iron fence that surrounds the garden.  Even at night, the bright colors of flowers stand out against the shadows, obviously tended on a regular basis.

At one point, this walkway was nothing more than a simple roof, now worked over with fresh beams of polished acanth for sturdy footing.  A tower pokes up from the far end of the walkway, holding aloft a large bell that peeks out of windows near the top.  Below, on either side of the building on which the walkway rests, sit well-tended and thick gardens.</description>
    <description>Lines of lit torches flank the sides of the walkway, their glare a bit too bright to make sense of the odd shadows that dance in the gardens below.  Perhaps the motion in those gardens is nothing more than an illusion created by the flicker of lights here, but the dark and elegant spire that stretches upwards at the other end of the walkway is hardly false.  Only when a torch shimmers just right does the outline of the shade reveal itself to be a bell tower.</description>

A tossed stone would have to travel no further than an arm's distance past the fence before it'd be flying over nothing but the water's surface.  The shores of M'Riss from this distance are far out of reach of any tossed thing, however, and can be seen as only a bold tree-lined ridge far away.</description>
    <description>The murky waves of the bay splash just beyond an empty space in the plants hanging from the back fence, merely an arm's throw away.  Further away is the dark smudge of M'Riss's shore that blocks the horizon, lit only by the tiny twinkling lights of traders moving along the Ring Road.

    <description>Several candles cast a warm glow on the polished rosewood counter spanning the back third of the room.  An elderly clerk stands behind the counter, ready to serve people seeking citizenship.  Plainly framed documents interspersed with banners and flags hang from the walls, and historical mementos are housed in a case near the entrance.  A large bronze plaque is affixed to the wall near the case.  Amid the mishmash of artifacts, and perhaps an artifact himself, sits an old man whittling.</description>

    <description>Stone troughs along the edges of the rooftop serve a dual purpose as homes for flowering plants and as guard rails to keep sky-watching mages from stumbling off into the gardens two stories below.  Spider vines arc over the ledges and flow downward, unafraid of the height.  To the west, the roof of the commodities building stares into the sky in poor imitation of the scholars that use this manor.</description>

A blank spot some distance below hints that one of the gargoyles may have lost its mortared hold on the wall and plummeted into the canal.  Poking out over the edge of the rooftop, and uncaring of the canal's rushing waters, is a polished blackwood telescope set neatly onto a raised pedestal at the southern end of the roof.</description>

A carved sandalwood door breaks the monotony of the paneling along the southern wall.  Tacked to the center of the door is a curled note, pierced through the middle by a bent nail.  At the far end of the hall, a spiral staircase rises through a covered opening in the roof, while opposite, a set of wide steps descends to the lower floor.</description>

Tools, templates and patterns hang above a small work area where artisans construct the purchased orders promptly as they come in.  Heat emanates from cracks around a leather curtain leading to the foundry.</description>

    <description>Along the top of one wall, a row of exhaust vents siphon off some of the oppressive heat generated by the fire in an attempt to make the room's temperature more comfortable for forgers busy at their craft.  An ingot cutter salvaged from the Undogoz Forge sits near a large pile of fuel and a leather curtain leads to the Maker's Mark shop.</description>

    <description>Already dark by its nature, the stone walls of the forge are blackened further by soot, ash and dust kicked up by the constant stream of workmen the forge serves on a daily basis.  Custodians hired by the city wander in and out checking the large waste bucket, making sure the discarded pieces of metal are cleaned up off the floor and keeping the foundry as clean of trash as possible.</description>

    <description>Emanating from the fire, patchy clouds of soot cover the ceiling and form streaks down the walls like black rain during a tropical storm.  Ashy dust fills the air, spiraling up in the heat as it blows off a pile of fuel.  A rhythmic hammering sound drifts over from the smithy to the west, followed by an occasional curse indicating things probably didn't go the way the forger desired.</description>

    <description>A combination of sweat and molten steel intertwine to permeate the air with a slightly acrid, sour smell that varies in intensity depending on the time of day.  Suspended by heavy chains secured to a blackened wooden beam is a huge granite crucible.  Piled high in the corner of the room is a large pile of crushed coal, waiting for the next forger to feed it to the fire.</description>

    <description>Once servicing the Undogoz Forge, select pieces of equipment, which still remain in good working condition, have found a new home here as part of the city's attempts to keep costs down.  In the room's center, a constant fire burns in the circular firepit with a small pile of fuel by its side, waiting to be added to increase the flames to a blazing inferno.  The clang of metal against metal drifts over from the smithy to the west and a heavy, oak door leads to the entry hall of the society.</description>

    <description>The back wall of the smithy area is covered with a grimy grey and red dust from the constant attention of the grindstone.  Several small windows along the top of the wall vent some of the choking dust and heat from the forge, but solid steel grates prevent anything larger than a gauntlet from passing through and into the canal beyond.</description>

    <description>Despite being swept on a regular basis by diligent custodians, metal shavings and bits of broken steel litter the floor, creating a sparkling effect when lit by the flames of the forge's roaring fire.  The smell of burning coal and heated metal fight for dominance here, indicating the amount of work this room normally sees.</description>

    <description>An oversized, glowing forge dominates the center of the stone floor, banishing all other equipment to the outlying corners of the room.  Nicknamed -- The Beast -- it's constantly consuming the red-hot coals in its belly and demanding more fuel from the pile, much like a ravenous animal.  From the smell of burning flesh lingering in the room, many craftsmen have felt its fiery bite.</description>

    <description>The floor bears the burns and scars from regular sprays of stray sparks.  Should only the stone surface be an ocean, the equipment scattered about would make a parody of an armada of ships, possibly in mockery of the failed attempts of the Dragon Priest Empire to subdue Mer'Kresh.  In reality, though, the only subduing going on is that of iron and steel beneath a determined worker's tools.</description>

    <description>Constant waves of scalding heat flow through the smithy, set into motion by the sizzling fires and red-hot metals being worked.  Even sounds seem warped and muffled, but somehow the echo of clanging tools and crackling of fiery sparks manage to cut through the thick air.  Nothing is spared the attentions of the temperature and dust, and both stone and metal tools wear the scars that the environment has delivered.</description>

    <description>Rising gently, the footbridge's arched shape is barely noticeable as it spans the narrow brook.  Spilling from the bridge's railing, roses and honeysuckle trail into the water and are tugged by the current.  Within the brook, glints of golden fish flash among the plants and sparkling coins thrown from the bridge by wishers and seekers.  The path away from the carillon parts the tufts of grass and cattails vying for space on the stream bank.</description>

    <description>Sheltered beneath a camphor tree, a proud basalt lion watches over his stone pride as they lounge in the flower-speckled clearing.  One lioness rolls on her back, one sniffs at a clump of lilies, while yet another sculptured lioness licks her cub.  Several stone cubs gather around a bronze paladin seated upon a basalt slab.  At the north end of the clearing, a grass and bamboo gate closes the path from further exploration.</description>

Flowers bloom all about the room, and a gablefruit vine climbs across the walls, flourishing in the illumination of a skylight set in the ceiling above.  Large displays, including those in the front window, hold freshly cut blossoms and bouquets that fill the air with intoxicating scents.  Floral clerks discretely watch over the domain, gently tending flowers and customers alike with gracious smiles.</description>

Strategically placed near the front window, a glass case filled with colorful, novelty candies works as free advertising to lure in customers from the street.

Across the room, a strong scent of liquor wafts into the air from the neatly stacked chocolates waiting to be purchased on the glass case.

Likewise, any diners glancing towards the exit are spared the sight of the host turning away unsavory types, and are only met by the gazes of the myriad of colored masks affixed to the decorative screen.</description>

    <description>Gaethzen spheres hang behind green shades, lending a soft glow that still reflects in the highly buffed and polished hardwood floors.  The only tables are those small enough to be carried by waiters, and remain in place only long enough for food to be transferred to an awaiting booth.  Screens of wood and paper create private dining areas for those artists too smug to allow others a watchful eye of their affairs.</description>

Along the sides of the seat, musical instruments of all types have been carved into the wood and rubbed with oil to a high sheen.  Someone has painted a cryptic signature with gold-colored paint on a small black shield etched with concentric circles that hangs overlooking the tabletop.</description>

Representing theater performers of some by-gone era, it's likely that most of the faces portrayed have found a stage on the Starry Path by now.  In contrast to the faded color of the portraits, bright purples and yellows streak the walls, and even the seat of the booth itself has been dyed in vivid shades.</description>

White alfar statuettes descend from her embrace, pierced by metal rods that hold them in place in the vignette.  To enhance the drama, the depiction of a clear night sky slowly dissolving into a sunrise has been painted in grand colors.  A few wavy letters mark the signature of the artist right near the side of the table.</description>
