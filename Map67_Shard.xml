A glinting flash of water beyond the street on either side catches the reflection of the buildings and two bridges rising gracefully up to the east and west, molded entirely of polished crystal.

    <description>The whisper of running water echoes down the street through the curtain of sound created by the push of the crowds and the call of hawkers.

The faint traces of the mark of Elven and Elothean architecture can still be detected by the discriminating eye, the carefully painted vines, flowers, and birds that cover the front and sides of the homes chasing each other as if trying to catch up with something -- or get away from another.</description>
    <description>Charming buildings constructed of seasoned wood painted in shades of white, blue, or beige line the street on either side, some three stories and roofed with silverwood shingles, some squat and flat.

Faintly, the drone of chanting or prayer echoes out from an arched window on the top center story.</description>
    <description>The imposing presence of a two-story building dominates the east side of the street.  Built of dark grey, sanded but unpainted wood and topped with a steepled roof supported by two thick beams of uncarved black deobar that look more like trunks than finished pieces of wood, a banner of grey silk snaps over the doorway, the image of a steel dove sewn boldly into it.  The sounds of grunting and the clash of steel echo from what open windows there are to mingle with the bustle of the city.</description>

The chuckle of a fountain splashing on through the night ripples through the streets, and the occasional reflection of candlelight glances over the road's dark blue stones.  A gate of ivory and brass divides the street to the north, its construction not daunting enough to keep the shadows at bay.</description>
    <description>A splash of green from flourishing gardens and the glint of light off crystal windows offers a tantalizing view of the homes of the privileged of Shard.  Houses alternately built with the Elven mind for arches and spindly, steeple-like points take up residence with the Elothean touch of round buildings with faceted domes.  Groups of citizens trod down the lapis-hued street, entering or exiting to the north via an ivory and brass gate that divides the inner city from its outer, more common sister.</description>

An inn built of seasoned wood is the only shop still open here, its windows and doorway bright with the glow of firelight and inviting the attention of those whose work does not end with the loss of sunlight.  A side street leads off into the stableyard of the inn, where the whinnying of horses can be heard.</description>

One inn built of seasoned wood seems to be the main attraction of this section of the lane, a cherrywood sign painted with a black rose hanging over the door.

    <description>Flames from smoky torches mounted on the city's walls flutter in a lakeside breeze and throw a fitful light over the ground, casting shadows on the Eastern Gate.  The shadowy outline of the Tower of Brickwell rises up to the north, the faint sound of snapping cloth coming from the Keep's direction.</description>
    <description>The Eastern Gate is the second most active entrance for the thriving trade of Shard.  The looming presence of the Tower of Brickwell dominates the view to the north, a multitude of pennants emblazoned with the arms of many kingdoms, baronies, and other sovereign states flying from its battlements and marking it indelibly as the staging grounds for the Shard Trader's Guild.</description>

Crumbling homes that can no longer support families, businesses that cannot stave off petty thieves or entice customers, and the shells of buildings have been left to rot along the street.  To the northwest, the grandiose beauty of the Great Tower seems to overshadow and demoralize what little dignity the residents here hope to cling to.</description>

    <description>A row of Elven women sit outside a small shop, reeds and strips of willow lying across their laps as they work to make baskets and mats.  One small girl sits nearby, watching as her mother works and learning the family's craft through silent observation.  The smells of the city -- a complex mixture of baking bread, yak dung, sweat, and green trees -- weave in and around anything and everything, racing over the people and the structures on a spirited lakeside breeze.</description>

    <description>Warm and fresh smelling, the conservatory is a mass of thriving foliage.  Among the many trees collected here are shining copperleaf, languid birch and graceful rowan, their branches arching overhead to shade the gravel walkway while brilliant firethorn bush and lush stands of enormous fern grow nearer to the ground.  Exotic flowering plants flourish next to hardier native species in a harmonious whole, their scents mingling in an exhilarating blend of spice, sweet and astringently herbal aromas.</description>

    <description>Hushed and silent save for the constant music of trickling water, the stillness of the night wraps this garden in peace.  Faint starlight through the glass reflects in the dark waters of the pool, lending a silvery sheen to the quivering surface and gleaming on the closed buds of the water lilies.  The trailing branches of the willows rustle softly, sheltering the iris and golden flag beneath its leaves.</description>
    <description>Serene and refreshing, this room is a refuge for those seeking a calm retreat.  The melodic trickle of water over stone provides a soothing background music broken by an occasional splash as one of the goldfish in the shallow pool leaps in a shining arc.  Deep blue iris, tall rushes, narcissus and golden flag are reflected in the shifting waters, and starry white water lilies cover the surface.  Slender willows bend to trail long branches in the pool and over the mossy rock.</description>

    <description>At rare intervals, a muffled thud is heard from the barber shop downstairs, as if something heavy had been dropped or something had exploded.  It can't be denied that these noises are often accompanied by an odd odor, but the location of these apartments is prime, and the tenants seem to take such events in stride.  The hall is at least well lit, with a large window at the street end.</description>

    <description>The angry sound of the madly rushing inner-city channels fills the air as the chilly waters sweep east to west on their way out of Shard.  A steep bank nearly thirty feet high pushes its way up to the north, the shadows from the Bridge of Sparrows changing the soil and bedrock that forms the wall of earth from russet brown to umbra.</description>

    <description>Rich brown soil dotted with patches of emerald green grass forms this bank.  Gradually changing from soft dirt to the hard bedrock of the city's foundations, the slope rolls down to a bank that allows one to skirt the edge of the rushing water channel over which the Bridge of Sparrows, rising to the west approximately fifteen feet away, allows passage.</description>

A couple of local thugs stand barely visible in the shadows, their alert eyes scanning passers by with a frightening intensity.</description>

    <description>The vast dispatch chamber is filled with frantic activity as caravan after caravan is quickly assembled and led out a pair of massive white ironwood doors, accompanied by the howls and complaints of those who feel they should have been first.  A shipping clerk is huddled at a desk piled with a mountain of invoices, trying to keep warm as all the heat from the room is sucked out of the opening between the doors.</description>

Twin columns, carved with images of sailing ships riding the crest of a wave, rise from the marble tiled floor.  A white marble staircase which leads to the upper levels of the tower is hung with the standards of trading companies based in the city of Shard.</description>

    <description>Surrounded by lush ferns, an expansive flagstone patio supports several smokewood benches and a small table of refreshments.  Vibrant crimson blossoms spangle the clematis vines that cover the trunks of a pair of dwarf maple trees standing guard at the courtyard's archway.  Glowing gaethzen orbs are tucked neatly within the fragrant lavender bushes that line the surrounding fence.</description>

An assortment of refreshments is on a squat oak table near the entrance of the chamber, very close to a lavishly dressed minstrel strumming her mandolin.  Her songs of war, peace, and heartbreak are improvised into one continuous song, interrupted only when she pauses to write down a word or two that pleases her.</description>

    <description>Enveloped in dark pink granite walls, the main entrance exudes a warmth of colors from the parquet bloodwood flooring to the multitude tapestries hanging from the ceiling.  Mannequins in one corner display a few of the masterpieces made by Ilithi's more promising tailors while display cases filled with jewelry items occupy another.  Overhead, a prestige board hangs from the intricately carved ceiling beams to display the names of the most dedicated to each outfitting discipline throughout each of the provinces.</description>
