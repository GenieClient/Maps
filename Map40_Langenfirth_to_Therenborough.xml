    <description>The rustic town is nestled in the Danduwen Forest, on the shore of a sheltered cove on Gwenalion Lake.  The fir and pine trees grow very tall and in thick stands, with a few birch and oak finding room to spread under the lower limbs of the taller firs.  The streets, more like paths, wind and twist past the huge tree trunks, obviously an effort to avoid cutting down any tree.</description>

    <description>The streets, nothing more than wide footpaths, thread their way in and out of the majestic old fir and pine trees.  It appears that the founding residents objected to the cutting of the trees, and simply followed woodland and animal trails as a guide to where streets should be.</description>

Piles of untanned hides sit on a wooden platform near the building, and those still curing are stretched on racks scattered about in a small cleared sideyard.  A small shingle swings in the breeze to one side of the door.</description>

    <description>The overhead foliage is so thick it blocks all but the merest glimpse of the sky.  Dappled sunlight occasionally dances on the ground, but for the most part, the town lays in the shadows of the giant trees.  To one side of the path sits a small cabin, built in the one-story, peaked-roof architecture common to the area.</description>

The rustle of underbrush and the distant call of an owl reminds one that the forest is as awake at night as it is during the daytime.

Langenfirth, originally a mere Ranger outpost, thrives now as a center for trapping and trade, having grown popular with woodsmen after the opening of the Ranger Guild.</description>

    <description>Clusters of catkins sway to and fro with a faint whisper as the velvety heads brush against each other.  Beyond, dried reeds carried by the currents drift together to be bound by thick ropy strands of moss.  While not overly stable, the resulting hummocks are big enough to support several people as they bob gently in the water, some close to the shore, others further out.</description>

    <description>Alive with movement, the fen is a tapestry of colorful threads being woven at a measured and unchanging pace.  Iridescent-winged insects swarm and buzz, glinting like jewels in the unfiltered light.  Birds fly low through the area and occasionally catch a plump bug as they wheel and swoop from the sky.  Even the vegetation shifts, the reeds and stunted trees bending in the wind and flowers bobbing with each ripple in the water.</description>

    <description>Solid ground stretches out to the west, far more solid, at least, than the somewhat wobbly surface of the reed hummock on which you currently perch.  The water between here and the shore is narrow enough to leap, though perhaps not without risk of a wetting in the process, and other hummocks bob in the water nearby.</description>

Jostled by adjacent hummocks, the relative position of each individual islet rarely changes, but the distance from one island to the next seems to vary from day to day.  Dark shadows glide beneath the surface of the water around you, and an occasional cry of a nesting gull echoes mockingly from the shore.</description>

Dried reeds carried by the lake's currents wash in near the shore to be bound together by tangled masses of water-weed, forming mounded hummocks that bob precariously on the surface of the water.  The floating mats are home to beavers, herons and other animals, and are probably sturdy enough to support your weight, assuming you can manage to leap over the gap between shore and hummock.</description>

    <description>Damp dirt held in place by a network of butternut tree roots forms the walls of a rounded underground chamber, rich with the scents of cool sweet earth.  A large rough-hewn thick plank serves as a counter, and a pale-haired Elothean teller with tiny mole-like eyes stares behind thin wired glasses in the dim light, waiting to do your bidding. The faint glow of a moongate in another chamber beyond dances within the shadows of a dimly lit earthen tunnel.</description>

    <description>A surly, grouchy dwarf sits near a pile of broken armor and cooking utensils banging away at dents.  Down on his luck he had, years ago, opened this shop to make a few coins.  Since then he has re-edged, banged out dents, grumbled, and complained but never quite made enough money, or so he says, to get back to his mining.  In a large bin are a number of odd things for sale, apparently items brought in for repair but never picked up.</description>

    <description>The temple is the only stone building in Langenfirth, built so long ago that history fails to say when or by whom.  It is believed, at least by the locals, that it was here long before the town.  The strange design and construction give weight to those beliefs.  The center of the room is taken up by a huge circular altar.  Through a wide arch is a quiet courtyard garden.  The stone of the walls appears roughly cut, but the blocks are extremely uniform.</description>

The hall has a homey feel to it, furnished to resemble someone's home.  Several chairs sit near a fireplace, and there is a well worn rug on the floor.  A ledger sits on a shelf covered with a thick layer of dust.</description>

While the towns tradesmen expect hard coin from travelers and traders, with the locals they will often barter stock for services or products.  The floor of the pen is covered with wet, mucky straw and the pen smells of both fresh and well-aged manure.  Over the years this small holding pen was built simply to keep the locals' currency from wandering about and bothering visitors.</description>

    <description>The trail opens into a wide clearing surrounded by towering oaks and slender birches.  Clusters of ferns line the edges, their delicate fronds brushing against moss-covered stones.  The ground here is packed dirt, interrupted by patches of hardy grass.  Scattered animal tracks mark the earth, while a hollowed log lies to one side, its interior home to small claw marks and broken twigs.</description>

    <description>At the heart of the forest, slender saplings intertwine to form a graceful living arch.  Their braided trunks rise in perfect harmony, bark patterns blending where they meet.  Fresh green shoots sprout from the weave, forming delicate fronds that dangle like ornaments.  The ground beneath is clear of debris, marked only by soft mosses that thrive in the embrace of the arch's shelter.</description>

    <description>The forest climbs a gentle slope, where large boulders protrude from the soil like ancient sentinels.  Their surfaces are mottled with patches of pale lichen and streaked with weathered cracks.  Between the stones, small saplings push upward, their leaves trembling in a faint breeze.  Evidence of burrowing animals shows in the loose dirt around the roots.</description>

    <description>At the base of the mountainside, a grove of silver-barked trees stands in quiet contrast to the rugged stone backdrop.  The trunks curve gracefully upward, their branches tangled with wispy vines.  A faint trail skirts the rocky incline, marked by scattered flakes of stone from above.  The low sound of rustling leaves accompanies the occasional movements of unseen woodland creatures.</description>

    <description>A shallow stream cuts through the forest, its pebbled banks lined with water-smoothed stones.  Narrow reeds and patches of cattails grow in the calmer pools.  Fallen leaves float lazily downstream, brushing against the occasional piece of driftwood lodged in the current.  Small pawprints in the muddy bank suggest a recent visit from thirsty creatures.</description>

    <description>A narrow path snakes through dense thickets of brambles, their thorn-laden vines twisting in a chaotic weave.  The air is faintly sweet with the scent of crushed berries underfoot.  Stripped bark on the lower trunks of nearby trees hints at the passage of foraging animals.  In places, the trail is barely visible, partially obscured by clusters of creeping ivy.</description>
