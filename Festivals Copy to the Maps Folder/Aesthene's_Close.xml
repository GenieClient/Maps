    <description>The narrow, sloping sides of the vaulted ceiling create a mirror-like effect that amplifies the vivid colors that saturate the room's curved walls.  Constantly shifting in their prismatic dance, brilliant rainbows emerge from a massive, glittering crystal that is suspended in mid-air at the very center of the room.  Multiple open corridors branch away from the circular room, but an undulating, kaleidoscopic ward blocks access to all passageways except for the one to the north.  An ornately gilded ramp, located directly beneath the crystal, leads downwards into another area.</description>

    <description>Overlain with decorative wood slats, the stacked stone walls form a narrow passageway to traverse through.  Tiny glittering tiles are pieced together into a colorful mosaic floor, depicting a pattern of swirling orlog faces.  Flanked by gaethzen sconces, jewel-toned brocade tapestries bring a touch of softness to the long corridor.</description>

    <description>Following the roadside along the Oxenwaithe's bank, you are struck by the quiet beauty of the place.  Taking pause to breathe in the crisp, clean air, you reflect on your surroundings.  Sand, sparkling as if mixed with diamond dust, pours into deep blue undulating waters.  A lush copse of trees spreads to the north, while to the southeast, a series of delightful small buildings is set back from the river's edge.</description>

    <description>Subdued lighting illuminates the tasteful wooden paneling of the room while a bevy of overstuffed furniture provides comfortable seating for those contemplating weighty choices.  Thick plush carpets in a myriad of hues cover the floor, almost totally obscuring the pale wooden planks of the flooring.  Around the walls, a number of colored archways contain magical portals that, when open, allow access to the prize rooms beyond.  A large set of double doors allows access to rooms devoted to dispenser activities while a round opening leads to the area devoted to workshops for alterations.</description>
