    <description>The wooden palisade of the town wall runs down into the river, ending in the West Tower.  A narrow gate allows exit from the town into the countryside.  South of the road, a narrow strip of muddy ground surrounds numerous shanties where the local fishermen draw up their boats and work on their nets.  Small but well-kept houses line the northern side of the road where some of the more prosperous fisherfolk dwell.</description>

    <description>Along the river, small warehouses brood on the muddy bank.  Soft lights glimmer from behind the curtained windows of a row of genteel houses nearby.  Laughter and a snatch of song drifts on the night air from a nearby group fishermen enjoying their off hours.  The sound of the night watch, pacing along the roadway reminds you that this town never completely sleeps.</description>
    <description>Small warehouses belonging to minor Traders dot the southern side of the road fronting on the river itself.  Heavy wagons pulled by enormous draft animals crawl by, raising a cloud of dust and salt.  Several children dart in and out among the carts, unheeding of the danger of hoof and wheel as they play tag or hop onto the carts' rigging for a ride.</description>

    <description>Warm light spills out from a nearby tavern.  The river gurgling quietly nearby and the cool night air makes the scents of cooking and good ale seem even more tempting.  A burst of laughter from the open doorway tells you that many have found a refuge from the night and loneliness.</description>
    <description>The smell of good food wars with the eternal odor of salt fish in the air and finally wins out.  A half-timbered tavern on the north side of the road seems to be the source of the pleasant aromas.  A group of people are gathered on benches beneath the overhanging second story, enjoying the spectacle of the busy street while quaffing enormous mugs of the local brew and downing large portions of edibles.</description>

    <description>Despite the late hour, the traffic is surprisingly heavy cargoes being hauled along, groups of sailors seeking refreshment and diversion, prosperous merchants hurrying home and so on.  The clank of a squad of armed city guards echoes as they dash past, lamplight gleaming from their polished helmets and pikes as they hasten to their posts.</description>
    <description>Midway between the western watch tower and the center of town, the road bustles with traffic of all sorts.  Horse-drawn wagons vie with overstuffed handcarts, while porters elbow their way between fishermen hauling baskets of fish.  Underfoot, urchins scoot and skitter in endless complex games beyond the grasp of the heedless adults around them.</description>

    <description>The gentle scent of baking bread rides the night air and vanquishes both rivermud and salt fish completely for a time.  The open door and windows of a cheerful bakery beckon warmly to those passing by to come in and sample the wares.</description>
    <description>A small cluster of shops forms a wider spot on the river road.  Displacing the drab warehouses, the brightly-painted stores beckon the passerby to turn aside from mundane cares and enjoy life.  A line of children stand, noses pressed against the mullioned windows, outside what can only be a bakery, judging by the heavy scent of cinnamon and other sweet spices that floats on the air.  You feel rather tempted to join the eager row of hungry faces and see what treats reside within.</description>

    <description>A cluster of fine shops entices the well-to-do townsfolk to come in and browse.  Several shopgirls stand together outside one store decorated with ribbons and bows, apparently on their break.  They chatter amongst themselves and pass judgement on the fitness of various males passing by with whistles of approbation or giggles of amusement at some pot-bellied merchant wearing something that would be fashionable on anyone but him.</description>

    <description>The road skirts both the Town Square and the Trader's Guild as it passes through the center of town.  The tall signal tower of City Hall rises like the spire of some Temple.  The nearby Municipal Pier is a hotbed of activity with ships coming and going and knots of Traders huddled deep in conclave over the latest prices.  The elegant facade of the Guildhall beams down on these activities with a proprietary air.</description>

Here and there, benches for the public's use are set out under shady trees, and you can often find an old retired merchant or river captain taking his ease and watching the passing tide of people.</description>

Perhaps as much business is done here as in the Guildhall nearby and certainly in much more cordial circumstances.  Both public and private dining can be had as well as a huge common room.  Sleeping accommodations range from the simple but clean to several elegant suites worthy of a Master Trader.</description>

Huge piles of sea salt, brought up the weary miles by barge, lie protected under canvas covers to keep off the rain. The riverbank has been despoiled by the briny run-off and little survives there.  Even the pier is eaten away by the salt. The wood looks ready to crumble at a touch.</description>

A small path passes beneath the tower's shadow and through a narrow gate, wandering along the barren riverbank and out of town.  A few boats are pulled up along the shore or bob gently in the current, tied to the many poles used to control river traffic.</description>

    <description>Several fish-drying sheds assault your nose with the intensity of their efforts.  One, worse even than the others, appears to specialize in some form of pickled fish mixed with some pungent herb or spice that settles into your nose as if it intended to dwell there.  You wonder how the guards in the Eastern Tower, set in the river at the end of the town wall to the south, survive it.  It does seem to have the minor virtue of driving off the blood flies that infest the river's edge.</description>

    <description>South of here, the road runs down to River Road and the river itself.  A few houses are scattered about, looking a bit shabby and mildly unkempt.  The damp river smell mingles with the odor of fish in a slightly noisome mix.  The one outstanding feature here is the store front of Ioun's pawnshop.  Resembling the aftermath of an explosion in a dry goods warehouse, you see everything from the newest in wares, to items only your grandfather would use.</description>

    <description>The Empath Hospital gleams in the darkness of night.  Fresh herbs and flowers scent the night air and sweep the cobwebs of care and toil from your mind.  Even the fresh-scrubbed cobblestones beneath your feet seem to share in the easing of your path, as they help your feet along their way.</description>

The gentle atmosphere of peace and healing reaches even into this side road cleanses the traveler of care and worry.  An apprentice of the Empath Guild washes down the cobbled roadway with clean water and scrubs the stones with a stiff brush.  His serene look makes even this humble task into an act of giving to others.</description>

    <description>This gloomy room would be windowless were it not for the items in the work box.  A foul-faced Dwarven man hunches over a low table, his grubby fingers fiddling with bits of putty and splintered wooden slats in a reluctant effort to patch up the forlorn objects entrusted to his care.  Given appropriate encouragement, the idle glazer has been known to sell the elderly windows rather than expend his energies mending them.</description>

    <description>The benighted alley is barely visible to the passers-by hurrying along Blackmoon Road, their eyes fixed straight ahead and their thoughts set on the comforts of home.  At this hour, the ordinary townsfolk know better than to glance over here and risk witnessing something the locals would much rather keep to themselves.</description>
    <description>A short step away from the bustle of Blackmoon Road, this sunless alley slips into the shadows like an asp.  A thick silence hangs heavily in the hot breath of the buildings it serves, muffling footsteps and muting the busy hum of the outside world.  The ever-present stench of salt and drying fish crowds in, clinging to clothing and chiding remembrance of the industrious warehouses which dominate this part of town.</description>

Unidentifiable items clatter and disperse under any stumbled footstep, awakening echoes fit to shatter windows in comparison with the fraught silence.</description>
    <description>Enclosed almost completely by the backs of tall structures, the alley is shrouded in long shadows even during the day.  Underfoot, indiscernible discarded items make the footing treacherous and slippery, forcing passers-by to thrust their arms outward, as if sightless, in hopes of grabbing some handhold to keep from stumbling to the filthy floor.</description>

Somewhere within a recess between two storehouses, sharp eyes memorize every feature of your face and clothing, but the intermittent glint of moonlight on cold metal cautions against looking too closely in return.</description>
    <description>A towering stack of tea chests and wooden pallets sprawls outward from a recess between two storehouses, creaking quietly with every slight settling of one box against another.  Innumerable sets of footprints and wheelmarks criss-cross the alley, etching the signs of frequent business into the dead end's flint and grit surface.  Overhead, a faded wooden sign screeches a protest at every scrap of breeze which sets it swinging on its rusty iron chains.</description>

    <description>Gazing from the top of this lofty tower, all of Riverhaven is displayed before you.  To the north, far away, palisade walls nestle into the low mountains.  A breeze brings smells and sounds from the warehouse district directly below.  Peering over the side, you see the river rushing by below.  From this height you are unable to hear its sounds but the moisture of the river still makes its way up.</description>

    <description>This is the tower's armory and storage room.  The walls are hung with swords, shields, pikes and all manner of weaponry, and the floors are stacked with boxes of crossbow bolts, arrows, and crates of food and supplies.  The outer wall of the tower forms a neat semi-circle, with a wooden partition dividing this floor of the tower in half.</description>

Maps, reports, and requisitions cover a large table set under the window, opposite two comfortable beds flanking the doorway to the next room.</description>

A raised platform in the center of the tower supports a hinged pole, which looks like it might be a mounting for a ballista.  A tarp is strung across four poles to one side of the area, to provide some shelter against the weather for the guards constantly stationed here.</description>

The smell of salt is particularly strong here, due in large part to Natron's Workyard and the scatterings of his product which slip under the boundary fence.</description>

    <description>The lane closes in a dead end of tawdry tradesmen's entrances.  Several large trash containers lean against one wall, strewing sodden bags and empty food wrappers all over the beginnings of a deeply rutted dirt path which leads off to the west.  The town's refuse collectors are clearly among those people who avoid the area as much as possible.</description>
    <description>During the hours of darkness, several overfilled trash containers sprawl their contents yet further across the path as cats and rats and all manner of beggared beasts seek out a meal amidst the day's refuse.  Occasional loud squeaks and yowls of displeasure echo around the area as the scavengers fight for the best pickings.</description>

    <description>The impacted dirt pathway is treacherously pot-holed and as hard as stone underfoot.  Over the years, heavy rains and hot sun have petrified the deep ruts formed by heavily-laden handcarts passing this way under cover of darkness, their burdens of contraband moving silently through the side streets leading up from the docks, onward bound to unknown destinations in Riverhaven and beyond.</description>
    <description>The treacherous pot-holes underfoot make the dirt pathway dangerous for anyone not completely familiar with the area.  Many an uttered curse has fouled the air here as nightblind pedestrians stumble and sprain an ankle in their haste to depart the Rookery in one piece and without a knife between their shoulderblades.</description>

    <description>Despite the efforts of some residents to brighten their surroundings with a splash of paint or a scrap of colored fabric hanging in a window, the area's silent and perilous nightly business overpowers the atmosphere with breathless suspense and no small measure of prickling fear.  Upon closer inspection, even the most meager dwelling has a sturdy lock on its door.</description>
    <description>Residents tend to keep their homes under lock and key at all times in this dangerous neighborhood, but at dusk many even go so far as to board up their windows from the inside.  For those uninvolved in the nightly industry of the Rookery, even catching a glimpse of any nocturnal deal-making can be a risky business.</description>

    <description>Heaped in a corner, a tangled fishing net buzzes with flies and festers with the nauseating stench of rotting fish.  When it was first dumped here, a steady trickle of brackish water dripped off it and pooled into what is now a sticky brown stain in the dirt.  At least, the circumstances suggest it's a pool of water, but in the Rookery any stain on the ground could just as easily be blood.</description>

A coil of heavy jute rope hangs on an iron hook nailed to the side wall of a locked wooden shack.  Beneath it, a pile of neatly-folded but grimy hessian tarps awaits usage during the night.</description>
    <description>Silent figures move to and fro, pulling handcarts and wheelbarrows from a stack against one wall.  The dim glow of a pipe bobs back and forth, its tiny light and the occasional wisp of foul-smelling smoke the only clue that a real being is here, working to coordinate the concealed influx of contraband and the intermittent visits by contacts coming to collect their illicit wares.</description>

This is the one spot in the Rookery which receives any direct sunlight, and for those residents who are out and about during the day, it makes a reasonable place to sit and discuss clandestine transactions or quietly make arrangements for the next night's activities.</description>
    <description>A few reed torches glow dimly around some wooden benches, giving off just enough light to see the faces and clothing of others in the area.

In the far distance, a glimpse of Lake Gwenalion glitters against the rustic blue-grey shoreline of Langenfirth.</description>
    <description>Perched high above the rooftops of Riverhaven, the night-time view from the lookout tower is magnificent.  The bobbing lights of the ferries and barges slowly traverse the still black water toward Langenfirth, a glimmering golden band in the far distance.

    <description>A set of alchemical equipment is centered in this laboratory carved out of dense granite.  The high ceilings are dotted with small holes that provide a way for any deadly gasses released to eventually make their way to the surface, while a passage to the south affords anyone in the room the chance to escape from a dangerous conflagration of chemicals.</description>

Variegated greens, oranges and yellows dapple the craggy rocks that comprise the shore, the flowering mosses and brightly colored lichens bringing soft beauty to an otherwise dour landscape.  Several tiny, dead fish are strewn about the wooden walkway, their bloated corpses untouched by the throngs of birds living in the surrounds.</description>

Crafted entirely from salvaged materials, the building is a jumble of mismatched and ill-fitted castoffs, starkly contrasting the neat, brightly painted sign proclaiming it to be open for business.  A large, crudely-cast bronze statue of an aquatic monster sits near the entrance, its surface a verdigris patina that lends a bit too much realism to the creature.</description>

The briny smell that permeates the entire establishment is particularly strong here, no doubt due to the open barrels of fish shoved between the other boxes.

Several rows of high-backed benches are arranged in the center of the room, each roughly carved from sturdy strips of waterproofed oak.  A small window looks out on the river below, though part of it is taken up by the ship docked nearby.</description>
