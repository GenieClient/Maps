White-robed figures and all manner of injured and infirm people stream in and out of a double door, leaving thin trails of blood on the spotless pavement.</description>

    <description>Not far off you spot the town walls, which meet at a right angle in this northeast corner of town.  This road is kept busy by the traffic to and from the popular haunts crowded into this sector - the Barbarians' Guild, the Champions' Arena, the Empaths' Guild, Martyr Saedelthorp's Healing Hospital, and the convivial Gaethrend's Court Inn.  In addition, the Paladins' Guild farther north, and the gate leading out of town to the Warrior Mages' Guild and the wilds all are accessed through this street.</description>

    <description>This bustling junction presents a cross section of the world's inhabitants in various states of health and disrepair.  Bloodied adventurers, impaired healers, overextended spellsingers, and other members of the walking wounded lurch their way towards the Healing Hospital to the west.  Litters, carts and horses carry those too badly hurt to move under their own power.  In striking contrast are the strapping barbarians who swagger by, towards the Arena and Barbarians' Guild southwest.</description>

You can barely make out on its surface scrawled inscriptions and graffiti with names and titles of barbarians of yore.  Some of the engravings have dates and numbers next to them.  A gust of wind blows the scent of incense offered in the flames on the Temple towers to mix with the odors of sweated bodies.</description>

Vines cling gratefully to the walls, their tendrils seeking ever-tighter grips around the crosspieces of the trellises.

The walls that parallel Kertigen Road on its western edge offer security from the evils that dwell without, but do little to protect against those miscreants who choose to make the city streets their hunting grounds.</description>

Somehow, it is relatively calm compared to those roads that lead to the Town Green, Town Hall, the Bank and the other nerve centers of the Crossing.  The three towers guarding the temple thrust into the sky to the southwest, their flames a beacon for miles.  A bluejay lands on a ledge atop the wall, chasing a pair of mudwrens from their comfy perch into a clump of weeds along the side of the path.</description>

The white porch rails and pillars are muted by the night, the porch furniture crouched like slumbering beasts.  A greyish oval glows from the center of the door.</description>

Preserved for eternity, pelts of vanquished creatures alternate with beastial trophy heads, framing a large steel sheet embossed with the maker's marks of guild weaponsmiths.  On one wall, portraits of leading guild members hang beneath mounted weapons.  A round padded leather bench provides a place to sit while examining the exhibits.</description>

Narrow shafts of light from the well-lit arena pierce through the steel prongs of a massive portcullis, fracturing the gloom like glowing spears.  Through the foreboding gate, the imposing battle arena takes shape, beckoning all who dare.</description>

In the center of the courtyard, a small fountain, filled with the darting forms of tiny fish, babbles to itself.

    <description>A smattering of applause greets you when you enter the cottage.  Several seated youths are listening attentively to an Elothean lad at a podium who is addressing them.  He speaks animatedly with eloquent gestures, and his audience leans forward in their seats, captivated by his speech.  A Halfling instructress studies him carefully, occasionally jotting down a notation in her book.</description>

    <description>Straddling the Northeast Gate, the stone battlements overlook the busiest entrance to the city.  Stone merlons offer some cover to those fighting, and the embrasures appear designed to accommodate either onager or archer.  The cobbled walk only stretches a short distance to the west and south, where it is broken by the tall but unfinished expanse of the town wall.</description>

    <description>Before becoming impassable, the cobbled walkway atop the town wall slopes south toward the Segoltha River.  A small stone guardhouse is set snugly against the outer battlement wall, offering those warriors not on watch a place to shelter from the elements.  Some whimsical soul has set a flowerpot and a doormat proclaiming Go Away! by the guardhouse door.</description>

    <description>Although the defensive wall itself is sturdy and serviceable as it stretches toward the North Gate, the cobbled walkway atop the town wall crumbles to incompletion.  The chisel marks in the wall's stones are still fresh and raw, as if the rocks were set into place just recently.  From here, the most notable landmark is the Paladin guild and the homes near it.  On the inner side of the walkway, a low wooden barrier prevents anyone from stumbling backwards and dropping to the ground below.</description>

Barely wide enough for one person, thick brambles and brush allow passage in single file.

A desk and a stool are shoved up against one of the stone walls, and someone has made a chalk outline on the wall to mimic a figure sitting on the stool.</description>

Several young trees have gaethzen globes affixed to their braches, causing them to bend over the footpath and create a spacious, leafy arch large enough to permit even the tallest of Gor'Togs to easily pass under.  Woodland rabbits making their home in the foliage dart to and fro while searching for particular vegetarian delights.</description>

An end table resting in one corner supports a shiny bowl filled with mock fruit, each piece smothered in gemstones that sparkle radiantly under the soft glow of the red crystal chandelier overhead.  Fashioned into the shape of a carved ruby, the thick area rug upon the hardwood floor features lines of silver and indigo to highlight the faceting.</description>

    <description>Lining the curved walls, a series of raised cases outfit the dark, circular sanctum.  Thick black carpet stretches across the entire expanse of floor to maintain an aura of almost reverent silence.  Small glowstones set into the ceiling offer focused illumination only for the items on display.  A miniature skylight in the domed ceiling is precisely located above one of the cases, providing little light for the rest of the room.</description>

Elegant flamestalks bend in a gentle breeze, adding their fiery orange hues to a hedge of bright firethorn, and yellow vines twine around the sun-bleached garden gates which lead off the lane.  Rows of thatched cottages overlook the triangular intersection, basking in the blaze of color.</description>

Behind the low buildings, tall aspen and silverwillow trees sway gracefully in the high breeze that drifts down from the wilds beyond Crossing's walls, enfolding the city's spires and treetops in faint traces of cool, green freshness.</description>

    <description>Skalliweg Barrelthumper, proud proprietor of The Half Pint, perches alertly on a high stool behind the sleek, polished bar, shouting at serving wenches, cooks and customers alike.  Patrons dine, drink, dispute and dream on, in spite of the constant hum, draped over comfortable rush-seated chairs or hunched over well-worn tables.  Faces flicker and eyes glimmer in the dim light of the wrought-iron chandelier and candle stubs sputtering in crocks on the tables.</description>

    <description>In sharp contrast to the Main Saloon and more boisterous reaches of The Half Pint, this quiet chamber is softly lit and tastefully decorated with antique tapestries depicting famed minstrels and legendary troubadours from the annals of Elanthia.  The room itself has no tables and chairs, but rather a recessed wooden seating pit with overstuffed cushions scattered about the floor.  At the far end is a raised platform with a lectern, a low ottoman and a music stand.</description>

    <description>A more recent addition to the Half Pint, the dance floor has a polished hardwood floor and a chandelier crafted from brushed silver and tiny blue crystals.  A strategic placement of mirrors makes the room seem bigger then it really is.  The musicians sit behind a decorated rail that keeps the dancers from accidentally falling into their beloved instruments.</description>

    <description>Here are gathered some of town's most serious gamblers, gamers and wagerers.  They cluster about a few round tables rolling dice, rattling bones and casting shells.  Several square tables bear cards, tokens, game pieces, and painted wooden boards with various runes and numbers on them.  You observe a curious fact: the round tables heaped high with gold are surrounded by tense faces, while the crowds around the square tables are laughing, joking, drinking and enjoying themselves immensely.</description>

Furnishings of rattan and bamboo surround a small, gurgling fountain in the midst of a pool, around which are potted palms and exotic dwarf fruit trees.</description>

Capes lined with silk, fine ceremonial tunics, and elegant frock coates nudge up against leather jerkins and other more protective garments, all awaiting the touch of a master tailor to define them more perfectly for their new owners. Bolts of fabric, march like small sentinels along sturdy shelves along the edges of the room, protecting the modesty of some of the more bashful patrons.</description>

    <description>In a dark, fetid alley, hard behind the Viper's Nest Inn, you happen upon a small shrine.  Kicking away what appears to be rubbish from around it, you reveal a sculpted granite image of the serpent god Ushnish.  Seeing that, you realize with a shudder that it is not rubbish you just pushed aside, but offerings of dead rats, uncured, fresh skins and other offal left by devotees of the viper-headed deity.</description>

    <description>Cracked flagstones pave the grim courtyard of the Viper's Nest Inn, making you stumble as you feel your way along.  A scabrous-looking, dense deobar tree blocks off any light.  Trails of mud, dust, sweat and blood streak the pavement, as if heavy burdens of all ilk had been dragged through here.  In a corner of the patio is a broken clay urn filled with water, the only place where guests and carousers can wash, or dunk themselves to shake off the haze of their intoxicants of choice.</description>

    <description>A battered storm cellar door leads down into the room via a few rickety, decrepit wooden steps.  The musty odor and clammy air are intensified by the darkness.  A constant dripping sound and the scurrying of creatures unseen about your feet makes you utter a quick prayer that there are no impending squalls out over Segoltha Bay.  Leaking casks of sour ale, maggot-ridden hogsheads of flour, and dark-stained, shapeless burlap bundles can barely be discerned in the half-murk.</description>

    <description>The Viper's Nest is known throughout the land for catering to the dregs of society.  The premises are often frequented by spies, conspirators, thieves, smugglers, rogue adventurers and crooked traders.  Folks congregate around long, rough-hewn tables, hunched forward listening, gesturing or speaking in harsh, sibilant whispers.  The ale is warm, the viands are inedible, nonetheless the Pit is jammed.  You notice a large proportion of S'Kra Mur and Gor'Togs in the mix.</description>

    <description>The inn is not set up for overnight guests, but this cramped garret is often pressed into service for that purpose.  A filthy mattress with discolored ticking is thrown haphazardly in a corner.  Your feet adhere to the planks and, wondering why, you glance down to see reddish-brown spots that trail out the door.  A lone oil lamp provides dim light.  The harsh chatter of the crowd downstairs, and the scuffles from the courtyard insure that sleep here will be fitful at best.</description>

Recruits from the town's most formidable dungeons, a stint in the Militia their ticket to freedom.  Weary traders and travelers argue with them about tariffs, and a badly beaten thief and an unconscious black marketeer both dangle from iron manacles against the far wall.  You quickly turn and leave, hoping not to catch the eye of a surly guard.</description>

Several gaily-colored painted landscapes complement the rich hue of the paper, their heavy gilt frames resembling windows into perfect summer days.  The vibrant golden oak of the floor is muffled by a sumptuous woolen ivory rug with a deep, luxurious pile.  Several cheerful golden sconces provide bright -- but not harsh -- light, the oil they burn perfuming the air with a fresh citrus scent.</description>

    <description>A peaceful sanctuary from the bustle of the city beyond, neatly trimmed hedges shield this garden from the main road.  An ornate marble bench rests in the far corner whilst a neatly ordered rock garden frames the entryway.  A series of manicured lawns provide space for a peaceful stroll punctuated by the occasional flowerbed.  Interspersed amongst the flowerbeds, an array of thirty nine diminutive pale marble statues present an interesting distraction from the natural beauty of the gardens.</description>

    <description>Resting at the centre of the array of lawns and gardens, a large pond dominates the area.  Unlike the rest of the lawns this area retains an air of chaos.  Randomly placed stepping stones lead to the centre of the pond where a circular bench provides a place to view the entire garden.  An occasional fallen leaf swirls upon the surface guided by the eddies and currents caused by the small stream feeding the pond.</description>

Each tree bears an animal carving on its trunk in honour of the Immortals.  At the foot of each tree, a small alcove provides a place for offerings to the gods.  Further back at the edge of the lawn a tiny flower border has been placed in front of a neat row of homes.</description>

Now and then the surrounding foliage rustles with movement, though whatever is causing it cannot be seen.  Occasionally something glints in the depth of the shadows -- could it be watchful eyes?  But they appear and are gone again so quickly that perhaps they were only a trick of the imagination.</description>
    <description>Natural light filters down through the tree's mighty limbs.  The bark of the trunk is well worn with use, as if something or someone has been using this as a way of getting around.  Often, the leaves overhead flicker with movement as squirrels leap playfully through the canopy.  The tree has several crude carvings on it, apparently done by someone who had nothing better to do.</description>

Due to its quiet, tasteful decor, you are sure it must be someone other than Cormyn.  An ebony desk and a high-backed leather chair show signs of frequent use.  In the corner, a ceiling-high safe holds secrets to which you are not privy.</description>

A series of grunts and shouts sound out over the gathering while groups of cloaked figures shy away from the commotion and cluster together at mismatched sets of well-crafted tables and chairs that are carelessly arranged around the perimeter.  Occasionally, a figure draped in a feathered cloak moves through the dim flickering light in the room to stand near a nondescript box at the jagged entrance.</description>

A small end table pushed against the far wall displays an array of books in various stages of use, some closed, others opened, their assorted pages earmarked to denote several passages of interest.  At the center of the room, a large desk consumes most of the available space with its hulking form, scattered with crumpled slips of paper around two half-empty coffee mugs too long neglected to give off any steam.</description>
